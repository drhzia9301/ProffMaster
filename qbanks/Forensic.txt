"answer": "b. Rum",
"explanation": "Rum typically has a higher alcohol concentration (40-50%+) compared to Beer (4-6%) or Wine (10-14%). Whisky, Brandy, and Rum often have similar high concentrations (around 40-50%), but Rum can sometimes be higher (overproof). In standard comparisons, Spirits (Rum/Whisky/Brandy) > Wine > Beer. Often Rum is cited as potentially the highest among common spirits in these contexts."
