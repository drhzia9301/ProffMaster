      "c. Preterm labor",
      "d. Abnormal fetal lie",
      "e. Retained placenta"
    ],
    "answer": "a. Polyhydramnios",
    "explanation": "Bicornuate uterus is a Mullerian anomaly associated with obstetric complications like recurrent abortion (especially mid-trimester), preterm labor due to reduced uterine capacity, abnormal fetal lie/malpresentation, and retained placenta/PPH due to poor contractility or abnormal implantation. Polyhydramnios is typically related to fetal anomalies (e.g., GI obstruction, anencephaly) or maternal diabetes, not directly caused by uterine anomalies."

    "explanation": "Urinary stress incontinence is primarily due to the loss of support to the bladder neck/urethra. The pubourethral ligaments play a crucial role in stabilizing the urethra. A cystocele (bladder prolapse) involves weakness of the pubocervical fascia, but the incontinence symptom specifically points to the urethral support mechanism (pubourethral ligaments)."

While pregnancy/lactation causes high levels, among the options listed (physiological states), sleep induces a significant rise. *Correction*: Parturition (or immediate postpartum/suckling) has very high levels. However, if comparing basal states, sleep is the classic physiological peak. Usually, questions asking this differentiate between 'pregnancy' and 'sleep'. If Parturition implies the act of delivery/stress, it's high. But standard physiology MCQs often flag 'Sleep' or 'Stress'. Let's stick to Sleep as the circadian peak, though Parturition involves massive hormonal shifts."

    "explanation": "Follow-up for Molar Pregnancy (Hydatidiform Mole): Weekly hCG until normal x3, then monthly x6. If it falls to normal within 56 days (8 weeks), surveillance is usually for 6 months from evacuation. If it falls *slowly* or plateaus, it indicates persistent disease (GTN) and requires *more* monitoring or chemotherapy, not stopping.

Assuming standard WHO 1999/2010 transitions: Volume >1.5-2ml, Count >15-20m, Motility >32-50%. 'Normal sperm morphology' as a categorical 'true' characteristic is correct, but if forced to choose the 'false' logic, typically morphology has a very low threshold (4% or 14% or 30%), not 'all normal'.

NOTE: The classic answer usually tested regarding side effects is 'Delayed return to fertility' (not permanent) or 'Osteoporosis risk' (it DOES increase risk). However, looking at options: a) Increased ectopic risk is a known theoretical concern. b) Permanent infertility is False. c) Inhibits lactation is False (safe in breastfeeding). d) False (it decreases bone density). e) Failure rate is < 0.3%.
