================================================================================
Question 239 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4 days old baby girl born to G3P2 mother, presented with jaundice since her first day of life. Mother's blood group is O-ive and baby blood group is A+ive. On examination, baby is pale and icteric. Her total S bilirubin is 27 mg /dl , indirect bilirubin is 25.5mg/dl. The most likely cause of jaundice in this baby is:

Options:
✓ ABO blood group incompatibility
  Both ABO and Rh incompatibility
  G6PD deficiency
  Physiological jaundice
  Rh incompatibility

Explanation:
Jaundice on the first day of life is pathological. With Mother O-ve and Baby A+ve, both ABO and Rh incompatibility are possible. However, ABO incompatibility is more common, though Rh is more severe. Given the specific setup (O mother, A baby), ABO incompatibility is a classic cause. Rh incompatibility requires sensitization. But ABO is 'most likely' in general terms if Rh status isn't specified as sensitized, but here Rh incompatibility (O-ve mother, +ve baby) is very high risk if not first pregnancy. Wait, G3P2. If Rhogam not given, Rh is very likely. However, ABO is also present. Usually, ABO causes early jaundice. But Rh causes *severe* early jaundice. Options separate them. A+ baby has A antigen (ABO mismatch) and D antigen (Rh mismatch). Both exist. Option (b) says 'Both'. This is technically true. But often single best answer is needed. Rh is more likely to cause severe hyperbilirubinemia (27mg/dl). But if I must choose, 'Both' covers the full immunological risk.

================================================================================
Question 240 (KMC - 2023)

Options:
✓ Contrast enhanced CT scan
  Liver transplant referral
  Repeat AFP at 6 weeks
  Repeat USS at 6 weeks
  Ultrasound guided liver biopsy

Explanation:
In a cirrhotic patient, a suspicious focal liver lesion requires multi-phasic imaging (CT or MRI with contrast) for definitive characterization (wash-in/wash-out pattern) to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

================================================================================
Question 248 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old man with established cirrhosis underwent a six monthly surveillance ultrasound scan (USS). It showed a suspicious focal Liver lesion.

What is the most appropriate next step?

Options:
✓ Liver transplant referral
  PET scan
  Repeat scan at 6 weeks
  Repeat AFP in y months
  Ultrasound guided liver biopsy

Explanation:
In a cirrhotic patient, a lesion >2 cm combined with an AFP >200 ng/mL is often sufficient for a non-invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The next step is usually staging and treatment planning, for which referral to a specialized center (e.g., for liver transplant assessment) is necessary.

================================================================================
Question 627 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 52-year-old man with GERD develops dysphagia. Endoscopy reveals an ulcerated lesion in the distal esophagus. Biopsy shows mucin-producing glands infiltrating muscularis propria. What molecular abnormality likely initiated this transformation?

Options:
✓ TP53 mutation
  CDH1 inactivation
  BRAF V600E mutation
  RET proto-oncogene activation
  Barrett's metaplasia with intestinal-type columnar cells

Explanation:
The patient's history of GERD and the biopsy findings of mucin-producing glands (adenocarcinoma) in the distal esophagus are characteristic of esophageal adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett's esophagus. The molecular progression from Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma typically involves the early inactivation of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene, followed by the mutation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, which is a late event promoting invasion.

================================================================================
Question 628 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question 630 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old man with a 40-year history of smoking and regular alcohol consumption presents with progressive dysphagia for solids, unintentional weight loss, and retrosternal chest discomfort. Upper GI endoscopy shows an ulcerated mass in the mid-esophagus. Which of the following risk factors most likely contributed to his malignancy?

Options:
  Barrett's esophagus
  Obesity
✓ Smoking and alcohol use
  Achalasia
  HPV infection

Explanation:
The location of the tumor in the mid-esophagus, combined with the extensive history of smoking and alcohol consumption, strongly points towards esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Smoking and alcohol are the most significant risk factors for this type of esophageal cancer.

================================================================================
Question 631 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old man with a 10-year history of Crohn disease presents with progressive jaundice, fatigue, and pruritus. Liver function tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). MRCP reveals multifocal strictures and segmental dilatations in both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Which laboratory test is most likely to support the diagnosis of an associated autoimmune condition?

Options:
  Antimitochondrial antibody (AMA)
  Anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG)
  Hepatocellular ballooning
✓ p-ANCA positivity
  Elevated alpha-fetoprotein

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease) and cholestatic liver profile, along with MRCP findings of biliary strictures and dilatations ('beading'), is classic for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). PSC has a strong association with perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA).

================================================================================
Question 632 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28-year-old woman presents with intermittent right lower quadrant abdominal pain, diarrhea, and perianal drainage. Colonoscopy shows patchy areas of inflammation with deep ulcerations and cobblestoning. Terminal ileum biopsies show transmural inflammation with non-caseating granulomas. Which of the following features helps differentiate this condition from ulcerative colitis?

Options:
✓ Skip lesions
  Crypt abscesses
  Goblet cell depletion
  Pseudopolyps
  Inflammation limited to mucosa

Explanation:
The key features described – perianal disease, skip lesions (patchy inflammation), transmural inflammation, and non-caseating granulomas – are all characteristic of Crohn disease and help distinguish it from ulcerative colitis, which typically involves continuous inflammation limited to the mucosa and submucosa, starting in the rectum.

================================================================================
Question 633 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48-year-old woman undergoes abdominal imaging for nonspecific pain. CT reveals a 4.5 cm well-circumscribed mass in the liver. MRI shows a central stellate scar. Biopsy shows hepatocyte-like cells separated by fibrous septae. She has no history of liver disease or OCP use. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Hepatocellular carcinoma
✓ Focal nodular hyperplasia
  Hepatic adenoma
  Metastatic adenocarcinoma
  Cholangiocarcinoma

Explanation:
A well-circumscribed liver mass with a central stellate scar on imaging in a middle-aged woman is the classic presentation of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), a benign liver lesion.

================================================================================
Question 634 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old man presents with dull epigastric pain that worsens on an empty stomach and improves after meals. He has a history of chronic NSAID use for osteoarthritis. Endoscopy reveals a 1.5 cm ulcer on the anterior wall of the duodenum. Histopathology shows necrotic debris, fibrin, and chronic inflammation. What is the most likely underlying mechanism for this ulcer?

Options:
  H. pylori urease activity
✓ Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis
  Autoimmune attack on parietal cells
  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
  Ischemic injury

Explanation:
Chronic NSAID use is a major cause of peptic ulcer disease. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which leads to decreased synthesis of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are crucial for maintaining mucosal defense mechanisms, including mucus and bicarbonate secretion and mucosal blood flow. Their inhibition makes the mucosa vulnerable to acid-induced injury.

================================================================================
Question 635 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old man is evaluated for fatigue and change in bowel habits. Colonoscopy reveals an ulcerative, infiltrative mass in the descending colon. Biopsy confirms adenocarcinoma. Which of the following molecular alterations is most likely involved in early tumorigenesis in this patient?

Options:
  TP53 mutation
  MLH1 hypermethylation
  BRAF V600E mutation
✓ APC gene inactivation
  KRAS amplification

Explanation:
The classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence for colorectal cancer, particularly in the distal colon, is initiated by the inactivation of the APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) tumor suppressor gene. This is considered the gatekeeping mutation that leads to the development of an adenoma, which can then progress to carcinoma through further mutations (like KRAS and TP53).

================================================================================
Question 636 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2-year-old boy presents with intermittent cramping abdominal pain and vomiting. The mother reports passage of blood and mucus per rectum. On exam, a sausage-shaped mass is palpable in the right lower quadrant. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Volvulus
✓ Intussusception
  Hirschsprung disease
  Appendicitis
  Meckel diverticulum

Explanation:
The classic triad of intermittent abdominal pain, a sausage-shaped abdominal mass, and 'red currant jelly' stool (blood and mucus) in a child is pathognomonic for intussusception, where one segment of the intestine telescopes into another.

================================================================================
Question 637 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old male with fatigue and arthralgia is found to have hepatomegaly. Lab tests reveal elevated ferritin and transferrin saturation. Liver biopsy shows brown granular pigment in hepatocytes. Which histochemical stain would best confirm the diagnosis?

Options:
  PAS with diastase
✓ Prussian blue
  Oil red O
  Masson trichrome
  Alcian blue

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of fatigue, arthralgia, hepatomegaly, and high iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation) is highly suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis. The brown granular pigment is hemosiderin (iron). Prussian blue is the specific stain used to detect iron in tissue.

================================================================================
Question 638 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42-year-old woman presents with chronic diarrhea and bloating. She reports weight loss despite normal appetite. A duodenal biopsy reveals blunted villi, crypt hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Tropical sprue
  Whipple disease
✓ Celiac disease
  Ulcerative colitis
  Irritable bowel syndrome

Explanation:
The combination of malabsorption symptoms (diarrhea, weight loss) and the characteristic duodenal biopsy findings of villous atrophy (blunting), crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes is the hallmark of celiac disease.

================================================================================
Question 639 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old man complains of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath. He also notes a sore tongue. Labs reveal macrocytic anemia and low vitamin B12. Upper GI endoscopy reveals thinning of rugal folds in the gastric body and fundus. Biopsy shows glandular atrophy with lymphocytic infiltrate and intestinal metaplasia. What is the most likely underlying condition?

Options:
  Menetrier disease
  Peptic ulcer disease
✓ Autoimmune gastritis
  MALT lymphoma
  H. pylori gastritis

Explanation:
This patient has pernicious anemia (macrocytic anemia, low B12, sore tongue/glossitis) caused by autoimmune gastritis. The autoimmune destruction of parietal cells in the gastric body and fundus leads to loss of intrinsic factor (required for B12 absorption) and achlorhydria. The biopsy findings of glandular atrophy and lymphocytic infiltrate are characteristic.

================================================================================
Question 640 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65-year-old man presents with progressive weight loss and vague epigastric discomfort. Upper GI endoscopy shows a linitis plastica appearance of the stomach. Biopsy reveals signet-ring cells infiltrating the gastric wall. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Peptic ulcer disease
  GIST
  MALT lymphoma
✓ Diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma
  Carcinoid tumor

Explanation:
The presence of signet-ring cells is the histologic hallmark of diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma. This type of cancer is characterized by a desmoplastic reaction that causes thickening and rigidity of the stomach wall, leading to the 'leather bottle' or linitis plastica appearance on endoscopy.

================================================================================
Question 641 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 53-year-old woman complains of worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea. She was recently treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. Stool toxin assay is positive. Colonoscopy reveals yellow-white plaques over erythematous mucosa. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Ulcerative colitis
  Ischemic colitis
  Crohn disease
✓ Pseudomembranous colitis
  Infectious colitis

Explanation:
The history of recent antibiotic use, positive stool toxin assay (for C. difficile), and the characteristic colonoscopic finding of yellow-white pseudomembranes are classic for pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridioides difficile infection.

================================================================================
Question 642 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C presents with hematemesis. Exam shows ascites and caput medusae. Labs show low albumin and prolonged prothrombin time. What is the most likely cause of bleeding?

Options:
  Mallory-Weiss tear
✓ Ruptured esophageal varices
  Peptic ulcer
  Gastric cancer
  Erosive gastritis

Explanation:
The patient has signs of decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, caput medusae, low albumin, prolonged PT) secondary to chronic hepatitis C. This leads to portal hypertension, which causes the formation of esophageal varices. Hematemesis in this context is most commonly due to the rupture of these varices.

================================================================================
Question 643 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A liver biopsy from a patient with autoimmune hepatitis shows dense portal and periportal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, interface hepatitis, and piecemeal necrosis. Which serologic marker is most specific for this condition?

Options:
  Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA)
✓ Anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA)
  Anti-tissue transglutaminase
  p-ANCA
  Anti-centromere antibody

Explanation:
The histologic findings are classic for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) is the most common and specific serologic marker for type 1 AIH, the most prevalent form of the disease.

================================================================================
Question 644 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 27-year-old woman with a 6-month history of bloody diarrhea develops migratory polyarthritis. Colonoscopy reveals continuous mucosal inflammation starting from the rectum. Biopsy shows crypt abscesses and mucosal ulceration. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Crohn disease
  IBS
✓ Ulcerative colitis
  Diverticulitis
  Ischemic colitis

Explanation:
The key features of bloody diarrhea, continuous inflammation starting from the rectum, and crypt abscesses are characteristic of ulcerative colitis. Migratory polyarthritis is a common extraintestinal manifestation.

================================================================================
Question 645 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 68-year-old alcoholic develops severe epigastric pain radiating to the back. Serum amylase is 2,000 U/L. Two weeks later CT shows a 7-cm, thick-walled, fluid-filled mass adjacent to the pancreas. This structure is best described as:

Options:
  Abscess lined by neutrophils
✓ Pseudocyst lacking an epithelial lining
  True cyst lined by ductal epithelium
  Mucinous cystic neoplasm with ovarian-type stroma
  Serous microcystic adenoma

Explanation:
The development of a fluid collection following an episode of acute pancreatitis (suggested by the history of alcoholism, epigastric pain, and high amylase) is a classic presentation of a pancreatic pseudocyst. A pseudocyst is distinguished from a true cyst by its wall, which is formed by fibrous and granulation tissue rather than a true epithelial lining.

================================================================================
Question 646 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old smoker develops persistent painless swelling of the left parotid gland. MRI shows a 3 cm heterogeneous mass; biopsy reveals a mixture of squamoid cells, mucus-producing cells, and intermediate cells with t(11;19)(q21;p13) translocation. The tumor is:

Options:
  Pleomorphic adenoma
✓ Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
  Warthin tumor
  Acinic-cell carcinoma
  Oncocytoma

Explanation:
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor. The histologic description of a mix of squamous (squamoid), mucus-producing, and intermediate cells is characteristic. The t(11;19) translocation, resulting in the MECT1-MAML2 fusion gene, is a specific molecular marker for this tumor.

================================================================================
Question 647 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 29-year-old woman with Helicobacter pylori gastritis develops a sharply punched-out 1.5 cm ulcer in the duodenal bulb. Which factor provides the strongest mucosal protection at this site?

Options:
  Reduction of mucosal blood flow
  Acidic gastric secretion
✓ Bicarbonate secretion from Brunner glands
  Activation of pepsinogen
  Secretion of interleukin-8 by foveolar cells

Explanation:
Brunner's glands are located in the submucosa of the duodenum. Their primary function is to secrete an alkaline mucus rich in bicarbonate. This secretion is crucial for neutralizing the acidic chyme coming from the stomach, thereby protecting the duodenal mucosa from acid-peptic injury.

================================================================================
Question 648 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
An elderly patient develops rapid-onset bloody diarrhea after eating under-cooked chicken. Stool culture grows motile Gram-negative curved rods at 42 °C. Which extra-intestinal complication is most classically linked to this pathogen?

Options:
  Reactive lymphogranuloma venereum
✓ Guillain-Barré syndrome via molecular mimicry
  Polyarteritis nodosa
  Hemolytic-uremic syndrome
  Endocarditis of prosthetic valves

Explanation:
The clinical scenario and culture findings (curved rods growing at 42°C) are classic for Campylobacter jejuni infection. C. jejuni is the most common antecedent infection leading to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune demyelinating neuropathy. The mechanism is thought to be molecular mimicry between lipooligosaccharides on the bacterial surface and gangliosides on human peripheral nerves.

================================================================================
Question 649 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old obese woman has colicky RUQ pain. Ultrasound shows multiple radiopaque gallstones. Which composition is most likely?

Options:
  Pure bilirubinate (black) stones
✓ Mixed cholesterol stones with calcium salts
  Pure cholesterol stones (> 95 % cholesterol)
  Brown pigment stones with fatty acid soaps
  Stones rich in hemoglobin S fragments

Explanation:
The most common type of gallstones in the Western world, associated with risk factors like obesity (the '4 Fs': female, fat, forty, fertile), are cholesterol stones. Pure cholesterol stones are radiolucent. For stones to be radiopaque, they must contain a significant amount of calcium salts (carbonate, phosphate, bilirubinate). Therefore, mixed cholesterol stones with calcification are the most likely diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 650 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old female HCV positive patient notes painless fresh red blood on toilet paper. Anoscopy shows dilated venous cushions above the dentate line. Histology demonstrates mucosa lined by columnar epithelium with engorged submucosal veins. Which risk factor most directly contributed?

Options:
✓ Portal hypertension from cirrhosis
  HPV-16 infection
  Chronic laxative abuse
  Low-fiber diet
  Iron-deficiency anemia

Explanation:
The patient has HCV, a leading cause of cirrhosis, which in turn leads to portal hypertension. The description of dilated venous cushions above the dentate line is consistent with internal hemorrhoids. While common hemorrhoids are due to straining, in a patient with liver disease, they can be a manifestation of portosystemic shunting (anastomosis between the superior and middle/inferior rectal veins) due to elevated portal venous pressure.

================================================================================
Question 651 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old man presents with fatigue and malaise. Lab results show HBsAg positive, anti-HBc IgM positive, and anti-HBs negative. What does this serologic pattern indicate?

Options:
  Recovery phase
  Immunization
  Chronic HBV infection
✓ Acute HBV infection
  Window period

Explanation:
The presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) indicates an active infection. The presence of IgM antibody to the core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) is the key marker for an acute infection (within the first 6 months). Anti-HBs is negative because the patient has not yet cleared the virus and developed immunity.

================================================================================
Question 652 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old female has long-standing autoimmune gastritis. She now presents with epigastric discomfort and weight loss. Endoscopy reveals an ulcerated mass in the stomach body. Which of the following malignancies is most likely?

Options:
  Gastric lymphoma
  Intestinal type adenocarcinoma
  Diffuse type adenocarcinoma
✓ Neuroendocrine tumor
  Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)

Explanation:
Autoimmune gastritis leads to destruction of parietal cells, causing achlorhydria. The lack of acid feedback leads to G-cell hyperplasia and elevated gastrin levels. Gastrin has a trophic effect on enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, leading to their hyperplasia and, eventually, the development of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids).

================================================================================
Question 653 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 62-year-old man with history of gallstones develops a firm, nodular gallbladder. Histology shows gland-forming malignant cells invading the wall. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Cholangiocarcinoma
✓ Gallbladder adenocarcinoma
  Metastatic colon carcinoma
  Pancreatic carcinoma
  Primary sclerosing cholangitis

Explanation:
Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis (gallstones) are the most important risk factors for gallbladder carcinoma. The histologic finding of gland-forming (adeno-) malignant cells (-carcinoma) invading the gallbladder wall confirms the diagnosis of gallbladder adenocarcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 654 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65-year-old male presents with painless jaundice and weight loss. Imaging reveals a pancreatic head mass. Which tumor marker is most likely elevated?

Options:
  AFP
  CEA
✓ CA 19-9
  Chromogranin A
  HBsAg

Explanation:
Painless jaundice and weight loss in an elderly patient, especially with a mass in the head of the pancreas, is the classic presentation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CA 19-9 is the most commonly used tumor marker for this malignancy, useful for both diagnosis and monitoring response to therapy.

================================================================================
Question 655 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old woman on oral contraceptives develops sudden right upper quadrant pain. Imaging reveals a well-circumscribed liver lesion with hemorrhage. Most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Focal nodular hyperplasia
  Hepatocellular carcinoma
✓ Hepatic adenoma
  Metastasis
  Hemangioma

Explanation:
Hepatic adenomas are benign liver tumors strongly associated with oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use. They are prone to spontaneous hemorrhage and rupture, which can present as sudden, severe abdominal pain. This is a key distinguishing feature from other benign liver lesions like FNH.

================================================================================
Question 656 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 68-year-old man presents with left lower quadrant pain, fever, and constipation for 3 days. His WBC count is elevated. CT scan of the abdomen shows thickening of the sigmoid colon and pericolic fat stranding, with small pericolic air pockets. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Colorectal carcinoma
✓ Acute diverticulitis with microperforation
  Ulcerative colitis
  Crohn disease
  Ischemic colitis

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of left lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is classic for acute diverticulitis, which most commonly affects the sigmoid colon. The CT findings of colonic wall thickening, fat stranding (inflammation), and small air pockets (microperforation) are pathognomonic for this condition.

================================================================================
Question 657 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 14-year-old boy presents with tremors, behavioral changes, and hepatomegaly. Slit-lamp examination reveals a golden-brown ring at the limbus of the cornea. Which of the following lab results supports the diagnosis?

Options:
  Increased serum ceruloplasmin
  Increased serum copper
✓ Decreased serum ceruloplasmin with increased hepatic copper
  Increased urinary urobilinogen
  Increased transferrin saturation

Explanation:
The combination of neurologic (tremors, behavioral changes), hepatic (hepatomegaly), and ophthalmologic (golden-brown corneal ring, i.e., Kayser-Fleischer ring) findings is classic for Wilson disease. This is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by decreased serum ceruloplasmin (the main copper-carrying protein), leading to copper deposition in tissues like the liver, brain, and cornea.

Question 658 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old man develops profuse watery diarrhea during a business trip to Mexico. He has no fever, and the diarrhea stops when he fasts. Stool is negative for blood or WBCs. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism?

Options:
  Cytotoxin-mediated epithelial necrosis
  Osmotic diarrhea due to unabsorbed solutes
  Inflammatory cytokine release
✓ Exotoxin activation of guanylate cyclase
  Infiltrative damage by lymphocytes

Explanation:
This is a classic presentation of traveler's diarrhea, most commonly caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). ETEC produces a heat-stable toxin (ST) that activates guanylate cyclase, and a heat-labile toxin (LT) that activates adenylate cyclase. Both mechanisms lead to increased intracellular cGMP and cAMP, respectively, resulting in chloride and water secretion into the gut lumen and causing a secretory, non-inflammatory, watery diarrhea.

================================================================================
Question 659 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old cirrhotic patient undergoes ultrasound-guided biopsy showing bridging fibrosis and nodular regeneration. Which of the following complications is directly caused by the resulting portal hypertension?

Options:
  Hepatocellular carcinoma
  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
✓ Splenomegaly due to congestive backup
  Portal vein thrombosis
  Hepatic encephalopathy

Explanation:
Cirrhosis leads to increased resistance to blood flow through the liver, causing portal hypertension. This increased pressure backs up into the portal venous system, including the splenic vein. The congestion of blood in the spleen leads to splenomegaly. While other options are complications of cirrhosis, splenomegaly is a direct result of the backup of blood flow.

================================================================================
Question 660 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38-year-old woman with a family history of early colon cancer is found to have an exophytic, ulcerated mass in the cecum. Tumor sequencing shows high microsatellite instability without BRAF mutation. Which inherited syndrome best explains these findings?

Options:
  Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
  Juvenile polyposis
✓ Lynch syndrome (HNPCC)
  Familial adenomatous polyposis
  Cowden syndrome

Explanation:
Lynch syndrome (Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer) is caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes (e.g., MLH1, MSH2). This leads to microsatellite instability (MSI-H), a hallmark of the syndrome. These tumors are often right-sided (cecum) and occur at a younger age. The absence of a BRAF mutation is more typical for Lynch syndrome-associated cancers compared to sporadic MSI-H cancers.

================================================================================
Question 661 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 44-year-old long-distance truck driver notices bright-red blood coating the stool and feels a painless bulge during defecation. Anoscopy reveals dilated veins above the dentate line. Which pre-disposing factor most directly promotes formation of these lesions?

Options:
  Chronic portal hypertension
  HPV-16 infection
✓ Prolonged sitting with increased intra-abdominal pressure
  Low-fiber diet causing straining
  Anal sphincter hyper-tonicity

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with internal hemorrhoids. His occupation as a truck driver involves prolonged sitting, which increases intra-abdominal pressure and impedes venous return from the hemorrhoidal plexuses, leading to their engorgement and prolapse. Straining from a low-fiber diet can also contribute, but prolonged sitting is a direct occupational risk factor.

================================================================================
Question 662 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following parasites is most commonly associated with bloody diarrhea and flask-shaped ulcers in the colon?

Options:
  Giardia lamblia
✓ Entamoeba histolytica
  Ascaris lumbricoides
  Trichuris trichiura
  Cryptosporidium parvum

Explanation:
Entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of amebiasis, which can cause amebic dysentery (bloody diarrhea). The parasite invades the colonic mucosa, leading to the characteristic 'flask-shaped' ulcers with a narrow neck and wide base.

================================================================================
Question 663 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A child presents with perianal itching that worsens at night. Scotch tape test is positive. Which parasite is most likely responsible?

Options:
  Giardia lamblia
  Ascaris lumbricoides
✓ Enterobius vermicularis
  Entamoeba histolytica
  Taenia solium

Explanation:
Enterobius vermicularis, also known as pinworm, is the most common cause of perianal itching (pruritus ani), especially in children. The itching is typically worse at night because the female worm migrates to the perianal region to lay her eggs. The Scotch tape test is the diagnostic method of choice to collect and identify the eggs.

================================================================================
Question 664 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Helicobacter pylori colonizes which part of the stomach most commonly?

Options:
  Fundus
✓ Antrum
  Body
  Cardia
  Pyloric sphincter

Explanation:
Helicobacter pylori has a strong predilection for the gastric antrum. The inflammation it causes in the antrum (antral gastritis) can disrupt the negative feedback mechanism on gastrin secretion, leading to hypergastrinemia and increased acid production, which contributes to duodenal ulcers.

================================================================================
Question 665 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old man complains of burning epigastric pain relieved by food. Endoscopy shows antral gastritis and a small duodenal ulcer. Which of the following mechanisms is most strongly associated with the pathogenesis by H pylori?

Options:
  Direct mucosal invasion by H. pylori
✓ Urease-mediated ammonium production increasing acid secretion
  Acid suppression by bacterial toxins
  Decreased gastrin secretion
  Goblet cell metaplasia

Explanation:
H. pylori produces the enzyme urease, which breaks down urea into ammonia and CO2. Ammonia neutralizes gastric acid in the immediate vicinity of the bacterium, allowing it to survive. Furthermore, the inflammation caused by H. pylori in the antrum damages somatostatin-producing D cells, leading to unchecked gastrin release, increased acid production, and subsequent duodenal ulceration.

================================================================================
Question 666 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is the most common cause of acute liver failure in adults in developed countries?

Options:
  Viral hepatitis E
  Alcoholic hepatitis
  Autoimmune hepatitis
✓ Acetaminophen overdose
  Wilson disease

Explanation:
In many developed countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, drug-induced liver injury is the leading cause of acute liver failure, with acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose being the single most common etiology.

================================================================================
Question 667 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Prolonged prothrombin time (PT) in liver disease is due to:

Options:
  Increased albumin
  Decreased bilirubin excretion
✓ Impaired synthesis of clotting factors
  Portal hypertension
  Hemolysis

Explanation:
The liver is responsible for synthesizing most of the clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X, as well as protein C and S). In significant liver disease, the synthetic function is impaired, leading to a deficiency of these factors. Prothrombin time (PT) measures the extrinsic pathway, which is dependent on factor VII, a vitamin K-dependent factor with a short half-life, making PT a sensitive indicator of acute and chronic liver dysfunction.

================================================================================
Question 668 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with a mild case of acute, non infectious diarrhea is advised to take an over the counter medication that works by adsorbing toxins and excess water in the gut lumen. Which one of the following antidiarrheal agents is being advised?

Options:
  Bismuth subsalicylate
  Cholestyramine
  Loperamide
✓ Pectin
  Rifaximin

Explanation:
Adsorbents like Pectin and Kaolin work by adsorbing toxins, bacteria, and excess water from the gut lumen, which helps to increase the consistency of the stool and reduce fluid loss. Bismuth subsalicylate has multiple mechanisms but is not primarily an adsorbent. Loperamide is an opioid agonist that reduces motility.

================================================================================
Question 669 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 years old patient with a known history of alcoholic cirrhosis is brought to the ER with confusion, disorientation and flapping tremors. Lab tests reveal significantly elevated blood ammonia levels. Physician prescribes Lactulose to manage this acute exacerbation of hepatic encephalopathy. Which one of the following pharmacological action of Lactulose is primarily responsible for ameliorating his condition?

Options:
✓ Creates an acidic environment in colon that traps ammonia as ammonium ions
  Directly neutralizes circulating ammonia in the blood
  Enhances the ammonia metabolizing capacity of the liver
  Increases the absorption of ammonia from the small intestine
  Promotes the synthesis of urea in the gut

Explanation:
Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that is metabolized by gut bacteria into acidic byproducts (lactic acid, acetic acid). This lowers the colonic pH, which promotes the conversion of diffusible ammonia (NH3) to non-diffusible ammonium ions (NH4+). The ammonium is then trapped in the colon and excreted in the stool. Lactulose also has an osmotic laxative effect that helps flush out the ammonia.

================================================================================
Question 670 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old patient is diagnosed with neurocysticercosis for which he is prescribed a prolonged course of albendazole therapy. Which one of the following most common adverse effect of the drug the physician will be monitoring in this patient?

Options:
  Cardiotoxicity
✓ Hepatotoxicity
  Optic neuritis
  Ototoxicity
  Nephrotoxicity

Explanation:
Hepatotoxicity, manifested as elevated liver enzymes, is a common adverse effect of long-term albendazole therapy. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended during treatment.

================================================================================
Question 671 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old woman with a history of chronic constipation due to limited mobility and recent opioid use for hip fracture is prescribed a new laxative. Within a few hours of taking the drug she experiences abdominal cramps and a strong urge to defecate. The physician explains that this drug works by directly stimulating the nerve endings in the colonic mucosa. Which one of the following drugs was most likely prescribed?

Options:
✓ Bisacodyl
  Docusate Sodium
  Magnesium Hydroxide
  Mineral Oil
  Psyllium

Explanation:
Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative. It works by directly irritating the sensory nerve endings in the colonic mucosa, which increases peristalsis and promotes bowel evacuation. This mechanism of action can often lead to abdominal cramping.

================================================================================
Question 672 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6 months old infant is diagnosed with severe enteric fever. The microbiology report indicates susceptibility to multiple antibiotics. Which one of the following antibiotics would generally be preferred for initial therapy due to its efficacy and relatively safer profile in this patient?

Options:
✓ Intravenous Ceftriaxone
  Intravenous Chloramphenicol
  Oral Ampicillin
  Oral Ciprofloxacin
  Oral Trimethoprim-Sulphamethoxazole

Explanation:
For severe enteric fever (typhoid) in infants, a third-generation cephalosporin like intravenous Ceftriaxone is a preferred first-line agent. Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin) are generally avoided in children due to concerns about arthropathy, and Chloramphenicol carries a risk of gray baby syndrome in infants.

================================================================================
Question 673 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient taking metronidazole for clostridium difficile infection consumes an alcoholic beverage. She subsequently experiences severe flushing, nausea, vomiting and a throbbing headache. The biochemical mechanism responsible for these symptoms is the metronidazole induced inhibition of which one of the following enzymes?

Options:
  Alcohol dehydrogenase
  Alcohol oxidase
✓ Aldehyde dehydrogenase
  Aldehyde oxidase
  Glucuronosyl transferase

Explanation:
Metronidazole causes a disulfiram-like reaction when taken with alcohol. It inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol. The accumulation of acetaldehyde causes the characteristic symptoms of flushing, nausea, vomiting, and headache.

================================================================================
Question 674 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with an intestinal tapeworm infection is treated with Niclosamide. Which one of the following best describes the mechanism of action of Niclosamide against these parasites?

Options:
✓ It acts by uncoupling the parasite's oxidative phosphorylation thus inhibiting ATP production
  It binds to and disrupts the integrity of parasite's cell membrane
  It causes spastic paralysis by acting on nicotinic receptors
  It directly inhibits parasite's nucleic acid synthesis
  It increases the permeability of parasite to calcium ions leading to muscle contraction

Explanation:
Niclosamide is effective against tapeworms (cestodes). Its primary mechanism of action is the inhibition of ATP production in the parasite by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. This rapidly kills the scolex and proximal segments of the worm.

================================================================================
Question 675 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with irritable bowel syndrome primarily experiences abdominal pain and cramps. The physician prescribes dicyclomine to help alleviate these symptoms. Which one of the following options describes the mechanism by which dicyclomine produces its effect?

Options:
  Acts as a calcium channel blocker
  Acts as GABA receptor agonist
  Acts as an opioid receptor agonist
✓ Acts as muscarinic receptor antagonist
  Acts as 5HT2 receptor agonist

Explanation:
Dicyclomine is an antispasmodic agent that works as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in smooth muscle. By blocking the action of acetylcholine, it relaxes the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby relieving the cramps and pain associated with IBS.

================================================================================
Question 676 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient is undergoing maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis with Azathioprine. Which one of the following serious adverse effects is most likely to be seen with azathioprine?

Options:
  Acute Pancreatitis
✓ Bone marrow suppression
  Hepatotoxicity
  Severe anaphylactic reaction
  Steven Johnson syndrome

Explanation:
Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant whose major dose-limiting toxicity is bone marrow suppression, which can lead to leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Regular blood count monitoring is essential for patients on this medication.

================================================================================
Question 677 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 years old male is about to receive a highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen for lung cancer. To effectively prevent acute and delayed nausea and vomiting which one of the following combination of drugs will be prescribed as prophylaxis according to current guidelines?

Options:
  Dronabinol, Nabilone and Haloperidol
  Diphenhydramine, Nabilone and Dexamethasone
  Lorazepam, Prochlorperazine and Dexamethasone
  Metoclopramide, Palonosetron and Prednisone
✓ Ondansetron, Aprepitant and Dexamethasone

Explanation:
For highly emetogenic chemotherapy, the standard of care is a three-drug regimen. This includes a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (like Ondansetron) to control acute emesis, an NK1 receptor antagonist (like Aprepitant) to control both acute and delayed emesis, and a corticosteroid (Dexamethasone) which potentiates the effects of the other antiemetics.

================================================================================
Question 678 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old female is prescribed metoclopramide for acute nausea and vomiting following a surgical procedure. Given her age and the initiation of this therapy, the physician should prioritize education and monitoring of which specific and potentially severe adverse effect that commonly presents early in the treatment?

Options:
✓ Acute dystonia
  Diarrhea
  Gynecomastia
  Peripheral neuropathy
  Prolong QT interval

Explanation:
Metoclopramide is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. Its blockade of dopamine receptors in the central nervous system can lead to extrapyramidal symptoms, particularly acute dystonic reactions (e.g., torticollis, oculogyric crisis). This risk is highest in young women and children and can occur even after a single dose.

================================================================================
Question 679 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old male with chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis is scheduled to start therapy with Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir. He has no history of prior antiviral treatment. What is the appropriate duration of therapy in this patient?

Options:
  8 weeks
✓ 12 weeks
  15 weeks
  24 weeks
  48 weeks

Explanation:
For treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C of any genotype and without cirrhosis, the standard recommended duration of therapy with the pangenotypic combination of Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir is 12 weeks.

================================================================================
Question 680 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with a history of myocardial infarction is on clopidogrel therapy. He is diagnosed with GERD and the physician considers prescribing a PPI. Which one of the following PPIs has the least potential for clinically significant interaction with clopidogrel, making it a safer choice in this patient?

Options:
  Esomeprazole
  Dexlansoprazole
  Lansoprazole
  Omeprazole
✓ Pantoprazole

Explanation:
Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires activation by the CYP2C19 enzyme. Some proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), particularly Omeprazole and Esomeprazole, are potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and can reduce the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. Pantoprazole is considered to be a weaker inhibitor of this enzyme and is therefore generally preferred in patients taking clopidogrel.

================================================================================
Question 681 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis is recovering from an episode of variceal bleeding. He is now stable and is being discharged. Which one of the following medications is most appropriate to reduce the risk of recurrent variceal bleeds?

Options:
  Nifedipine
  Octreotide
  Omeprazole
✓ Propranolol
  Terlipressin

Explanation:
For secondary prophylaxis (prevention of re-bleeding) of esophageal varices, non-selective beta-blockers like Propranolol or Nadolol are the standard of care. They work by reducing cardiac output (beta-1 blockade) and causing splanchnic vasoconstriction (beta-2 blockade), which together lower portal pressure.

================================================================================
Question 682 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A hospitalized patient in the ICU is at high risk of developing stress ulcers. Which one of the following drugs might be used primarily for its mucosal protecting properties to prevent ulcer formation in this patient?

Options:
  Magnesium Hydroxide
  Misoprostol
  Omeprazole
  Ranitidine
✓ Sucralfate

Explanation:
Sucralfate is a mucosal protective agent. In an acidic environment, it polymerizes to form a viscous, sticky gel that adheres to the ulcer crater, creating a physical barrier that protects it from acid and pepsin. While PPIs and H2 blockers are also used for stress ulcer prophylaxis by reducing acid, Sucralfate's primary mechanism is mucosal protection.

================================================================================
Question 683 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with chronic Hepatitis B infection exhibiting elevated viral load and active liver inflammation is initiated treatment with Tenofovir, an oral antiviral drug. Based on its mechanism of action in inhibiting HBV replication, Tenofovir is classified as which type of drug?

Options:
  Immunomodulator
  Non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)
✓ Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
  NS5A inhibitor
  Protease inhibitor

Explanation:
Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). After being phosphorylated to its active form, it competes with the natural substrate (deoxyadenosine triphosphate) and is incorporated into the viral DNA by the HBV reverse transcriptase. This causes chain termination and halts viral replication.

Question:
Hospital administration is:

Options:
  Action oriented
✓ Policy oriented
  Focused on daily operations and logistics
  Focus on policy implementation
  Manages the staff schedules and patient flow

Explanation:
Hospital administration is primarily policy-oriented, focusing on the overall governance, strategic planning, policy making, and financial management of the institution. Hospital management, in contrast, is more action-oriented and focused on implementing those policies through daily operations.

================================================================================
Question 710 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Identify which one is an importance of planning?

Options:
  Reduce uncertainty or Risk
  Identifying alternative critically
  Developing leadership
✓ More than one of the above
  None of the above

Explanation:
Planning is crucial in management for several reasons. It helps to reduce uncertainty by forcing managers to look ahead and anticipate change. It involves critically evaluating different courses of action (alternatives). The process of creating and implementing plans can also help in developing leadership skills. Therefore, more than one of the options are correct.

================================================================================

================================================================================
Question 712 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 54 years old male who is diagnosed case of insulin dependent DM for last 01 month (on insulin therapy) presented with abdominal distension and ankle edema. On examination: shifting dullness was positive, investigations showed HB 14g/dl, TLC 9000, PLT 148000, urine for proteins was negative, ALT 90 U/L, Alkline PO4 130 U/L (Normal), RBS was 208 mg/dl. What is most likely diagnosis:

Options:
  Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
  Wilson's disease
✓ Haemochromatosis
  HCC
  Chronic viral hepatitis

Explanation:
The patient presents with new-onset diabetes mellitus ('bronze diabetes'), signs of liver disease (ascites, elevated ALT), and likely has underlying liver cirrhosis. This combination is classic for Haemochromatosis, a disorder of iron overload. The iron deposition damages the pancreas (causing diabetes) and the liver (causing cirrhosis).

================================================================================
Question 713 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 36 year old women presents with six month history of difficulty in swallowing solids & liquids, regurgitation and weight loss. A clinical diagnosis of Achalasia is made. What is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of Achalasia:

Options:
  Barium Swallow
  CT scan
✓ Esophageal manometry
  MRI chest
  Upper GI endoscopy

Explanation:
While barium swallow can be suggestive (showing a 'bird's beak' appearance), esophageal manometry is the gold standard for diagnosing achalasia. It directly measures esophageal motility and pressures, confirming the diagnosis by showing aperistalsis in the esophageal body and incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

================================================================================
Question 714 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 62-year old male admitted in Medical Ward with one week history of Hematemesis. He has history of Osteoarthritis knees and on NSAIDS for the last 05 years. Upper GI Endoscopy done revealed an actively bleeding Gastric Ulcer. Which of the following endoscopic treatment is recommended for this patient:

Options:
  High dose PPI
  Band Ligation
  Epinephrine Injection + Sclerotherapy
✓ Epinephrine Injection + thermocoagulation
  Injection of Tranexamic Acid at the bleeding side

Explanation:
For actively bleeding peptic ulcers, combination endoscopic therapy is superior to monotherapy. The standard approach is to first inject epinephrine into and around the bleeding vessel to achieve temporary hemostasis via vasoconstriction and tamponade. This is then followed by a second modality, such as thermal coagulation (e.g., heater probe, bipolar cautery) or mechanical therapy (hemoclips), to achieve definitive hemostasis.

================================================================================
Question 715 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 year old male with a history of Chronic Hepatitis B presented with unintentional weight loss and right upper quadrant pain for last one month .Alpha fetoprotein is elevated. What is the most appropriate next step:

Options:
  liver biopsy
  abdominal Xray
✓ Triphasic CT of liver
  ERCP
  MRI abdomen

Explanation:
In a patient with chronic hepatitis B (a major risk factor for HCC) and an elevated AFP, the next step is diagnostic imaging to confirm and stage a suspected liver tumor. A multiphasic (triphasic) CT or MRI of the liver is the imaging modality of choice. It can show the characteristic arterial hyperenhancement and venous/delayed phase washout of HCC, often making the diagnosis without the need for a biopsy.

================================================================================
Question 716 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following site is least commonly involved in Crohn's disease:

Options:
  Terminal ileum
  Colon
  Esophagus
  Stomach
✓ Rectum

Explanation:
Crohn's disease can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus. The most common site is the terminal ileum. While the entire colon can be involved, the rectum is typically spared, which is a key feature that helps distinguish it from ulcerative colitis, where rectal involvement is almost universal.

================================================================================
Question 717 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 year old lady presented with the bloody diarrhea , urgency and lower abdominal pain and cramps for the past 3 weeks. Workup done colonoscopy shows continuous mucosal inflammation in rectum . What is most probable diagnosis in this patient:

Options:
  Crohn's disease
  Pseudomembranous colitis
  Intestinal tuberculosis
  Carcinoma rectum
✓ Ulcerative colitis

Explanation:
The key features of bloody diarrhea, tenesmus (urgency), and continuous inflammation starting in the rectum are the classic hallmarks of Ulcerative Colitis. In contrast, Crohn's disease typically has skip lesions and often spares the rectum.

================================================================================
Question 718 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 29-year-old female presents with abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and diarrhea for 3 months. Colonoscopy reveals ulceronodular lesions in the ileocecal area. Biopsy shows epithelioid granulomas with central necrosis. Which of the following laboratory tests is most helpful to support the diagnosis:

Options:
  Serum C-reactive protein
  Stool culture for Salmonella
  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
✓ Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)
  Colon biopsy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain

Explanation:
The clinical presentation in the ileocecal region can mimic Crohn's disease, but the biopsy finding of granulomas with central (caseating) necrosis is highly characteristic of Tuberculosis. An Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) is a blood test used to detect a cellular immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a key test for diagnosing both latent and active TB.

================================================================================
Question 719 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28-year-old woman complains of intermittent colicky abdominal pain, fever, and significant weight loss over 4 months. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa. CT abdomen shows ileocecal thickening, necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes and ascites. Which of the following findings is most suggestive of intestinal Tuberculosis over Crohn's disease:

Options:
  Skip lesions
  Non-caseating granulomas on biopsy
✓ Necrotic lymph nodes with ring enhancement
  Cobblestone appearance of mucosa
  Long segment

Explanation:
While both intestinal TB and Crohn's disease can present with ileocecal thickening, the presence of necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes, often showing peripheral or ring enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT, is a highly specific finding for Tuberculosis. Crohn's disease typically causes homogenous inflammatory lymph node enlargement.

================================================================================
Question 720 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old lady with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension is found to have hepatic steatosis on ultrasound. She drinks one glass of wine (10g alcohol) per day. Her BMI is 28kg/m2. Labs showed HbA1c of 8.2%. What is the most accurate statement regarding her condition:

Options:
  she does not meet criteria for MAFLD due to alcohol intake
✓ she meets criteria for MAFLD due to the presence of diabetes and hypertension
  Alcohol intake must be completely absent to diagnose MAFLD
  MAFLD can only be diagnosed if ALT is elevated
  Liver biopsy is mandatory for MAFLD diagnosis

Explanation:
The diagnosis of Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) requires evidence of hepatic steatosis plus one of three criteria: overweight/obesity, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or evidence of metabolic dysregulation. This patient has both type 2 diabetes and is overweight (BMI 28), so she meets the criteria for MAFLD. The definition of MAFLD allows for some alcohol consumption and does not exclude patients who drink.

================================================================================
Question 721 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following represents serologic evidence of recent Hepatitis B virus infection during "window period":

Options:
  HbsAg
✓ Anti Hbc IgM
  Anti Hbs
  HbeAg
  Anti Hbe

Explanation:
The 'window period' in acute Hepatitis B infection is the time when HBsAg has become undetectable, but the antibody to HBsAg (Anti-HBs) has not yet appeared. During this phase, the only serological marker indicating a recent infection is the IgM antibody to the core antigen (Anti-HBc IgM).

================================================================================
Question 722 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 24-year-old female diagnosed with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhoid Fever in Karachi, Pakistan, has failed to respond to Ceftriaxone. She remains febrile after 7 days of treatment. Which of the following antibiotics is appropriate in this situation:

Options:
  Ciprofloxacin
✓ Azithromycin
  Amoxicillin
  Chloramphenicol
  Metronidazole

Explanation:
Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Salmonella Typhi is defined as resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (first-line agents), fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins (like Ceftriaxone). In this scenario, with widespread resistance, macrolides like Azithromycin or carbapenems are often the remaining effective oral and intravenous options, respectively.

================================================================================
Question 723 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the typical postoperative care for patients undergoing appendectomy?

Options:
✓ Early Mobilization and oral feeding.
  Prolonged bed rest and I/V fluids.
  Nasogastric suction and Bowel rest.
  Prolong antibiotics Cover.
  Prolong pain relief

Explanation:
For an uncomplicated appendectomy, modern surgical practice emphasizes early recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols. This includes early mobilization (walking) to prevent complications like DVT and pneumonia, and early introduction of oral fluids and food as tolerated to promote the return of bowel function.

================================================================================
Question 724 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the typical histopathological finding in acute appendicitis?

Options:
✓ Neutrophilic infiltration.
  Lymphocytic infiltration.
  Granulomatous inflammation.
  Fibrosis
  Necrosis

Explanation:
The hallmark of acute inflammation, such as in acute appendicitis, is the infiltration of neutrophils into the tissue. The diagnostic histopathological finding is neutrophilic infiltration of the muscularis propria of the appendix wall.

================================================================================
Question 725 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a characteristic feature of crohns disease?

Options:
  Continuros inflammation
✓ Skip Lesions
  Mucosal friability
  Pseudopolyps
  None of these

Explanation:
A key feature of Crohn's disease is the presence of 'skip lesions', where segments of inflamed bowel are separated by areas of normal-appearing bowel. This is in contrast to ulcerative colitis, which typically shows continuous inflammation extending proximally from the rectum.

================================================================================
Question 726 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the primary pathophysiological mechanism of Crohn, s disease?

Options:
✓ Immune system dysregulation
  Epithelial barrier dysfunction
  Gut micro biome imbalance
  Vascular insufficiency
  Neutrophilic infiltration

Explanation:
Crohn's disease is considered an immune-mediated inflammatory disease. The primary mechanism is a dysregulated and exaggerated immune response to commensal gut bacteria in a genetically susceptible individual. This leads to chronic inflammation and tissue damage.

================================================================================
Question 727 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the purpose of nasogastric suction in the intestinal obstruction?

Options:
✓ Decompress the bowel
  Administer medication
  Provide nutrition
  Monitor Bowel movements
  bowl rest

Explanation:
In intestinal obstruction, fluid and gas accumulate proximal to the blockage, causing bowel distension. A nasogastric tube is placed to suction out this accumulated air and fluid, thereby decompressing the stomach and small bowel. This relieves symptoms like nausea and vomiting and reduces the risk of aspiration.

================================================================================
Question 728 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the role of fluid resuscitation in intestinal obstruction?

Options:
✓ Prevent dehydration
  Maintain Blood pressure
  Support Bowel function
  Reduce inflammation
  Increase pulse

Explanation:
In intestinal obstruction, large volumes of fluid are sequestered into the bowel lumen and wall ('third spacing'), and vomiting leads to further fluid loss. This can cause severe dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypovolemic shock. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is a critical first step to correct dehydration and maintain hemodynamic stability.

================================================================================
Question 729 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 year old diabetic man has painless, smooth firm mass in the right iliac fossa. He also has a radio cephalic fistula. What does he most likely have?

Options:
  Appendix mass
  Colonic carcinoma
  Diverticular abscess
  Femoral hernia
✓ Renal transplant

Explanation:
The presence of a radiocephalic fistula indicates the patient is on or has been on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease. Diabetes is the leading cause of ESRD. A renal transplant is typically placed extraperitoneally in the iliac fossa (often the right), where it can be felt as a smooth, firm mass.

================================================================================
Question 730 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Hydatid disease is caused by?

Options:
  Ring worm
  Hook worm
✓ Tape worm
  All of the above
  None of these

Explanation:
Hydatid disease (cystic echinococcosis) is a parasitic infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus.

================================================================================
Question 731 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 37-year old women has had sharp and persistent and associated with defecation for 4 months. Occasionally there are small amount of blood on toilet paper on wiping. There is a fissure present in the anal canal at 6 o clock position. Which is the single most appropriate treatment for them?

Options:
  Anal dilatation
  Botox injection
  Diltiazem cream
✓ Lateral internal sphincterotomy
  Prednisolone suppositories

Explanation:
The patient has a chronic anal fissure (symptoms > 6 weeks). While conservative measures like topical creams (diltiazem, GTN) are tried first, the gold standard and most effective surgical treatment for a chronic anal fissure that has failed medical therapy is a lateral internal sphincterotomy. This procedure cuts a portion of the internal anal sphincter to reduce spasm, improve blood flow, and allow the fissure to heal.

================================================================================
Question 732 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old male patient presented with pain right hypochondrium and vomiting with high degree fever. He is jaundiced and tender in right hypochondrium. Most likely diagnosis in this case is;

Options:
✓ Cholangitis
  Cholelithiasis
  Liver abscess
  Pancreatitis
  Both B & C

Explanation:
The patient is presenting with Charcot's triad: right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice. This classic triad is the hallmark of acute ascending cholangitis, which is an infection of the biliary tree, usually in the setting of an obstruction (like a gallstone).

================================================================================
Question 733 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Black liver is characteristics of

Options:
  Griglar Naiar Type 1
  Griglar Naiar Type 2
✓ Dubin johnson syndrome
  Rotor syndrome
  All of above

Explanation:
Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a benign autosomal recessive disorder of conjugated bilirubin transport. It is characterized by a defect in the MRP2 transporter, which leads to the accumulation of a melanin-like pigment in hepatocytes, giving the liver a grossly black appearance.

================================================================================
Question 734 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Phenobarbital can differenciate between

Options:
  Griglar Naiar syndrome Type 1 and rotor
  Griglar Naiar syndrome Type 1 and Dubin Johnson
✓ Griglar Naiar Type 1 and type 2
  Rotor and dubin Johnson syndrome
  None of above

Explanation:
Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a disorder of bilirubin conjugation due to deficiency of the UGT1A1 enzyme. Phenobarbital is an enzyme inducer. In Type 2 (Arias syndrome), there is some residual enzyme activity which can be induced by phenobarbital, leading to a decrease in serum bilirubin. In Type 1, there is a complete absence of the enzyme, so phenobarbital has no effect.

================================================================================
Question 735 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Lactase deficiency is complication of

Options:
  Amoebic dysentery
✓ Rota virus infection
  E-Coli infection
  Compylo bacter infection
  None of above

Explanation:
Infections that damage the brush border of the small intestine can lead to a secondary, temporary lactase deficiency. Rotavirus is a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children that specifically damages the mature enterocytes at the tips of the villi, where lactase is most abundant. This leads to transient lactose intolerance following the infection.

================================================================================
Question 736 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following best reflects the concept of social accountability in healthcare education institutions?

Options:
  Ensuring students pass licensing exams with high scores
  Providing healthcare services only to paying patients
✓ Aligning institutional activities with the priority health needs of the society they serve
  Conducting cutting-edge research without considering community relevance
  Expanding private healthcare businesses to generate institutional revenue

Explanation:
Social accountability in medical education means that the institution has an obligation to direct its education, research, and service activities towards addressing the priority health concerns of the community, region, and/or nation it has a mandate to serve. It's about being responsive to societal needs.

================================================================================
Question 737 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Antidote for phosphorous poisoning is:

Options:
  a: 0.5% sol. of potassium permanganate
✓ b: 1% sol. of copper sulphate
  c: 5% sol of potassium permanganate
  d: EDTA
  e: no antidote for phosphorous poisoning

Explanation:
There is no specific systemic antidote for phosphorus poisoning. Management is supportive. Gastric lavage with a solution of copper sulfate (1%) can be used. The copper sulfate coats the phosphorus particles, forming insoluble copper phosphide, which prevents its absorption. However, this is controversial due to the toxicity of copper sulfate itself.

================================================================================
Question 738 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Rain drop pigmentation of skin is seen in:

Options:
  a: chronic lead poisoning
✓ b: chronic arsenic poisoning
  c: chronic mercury poisoning
  d: chronic copper poisoning
  e: chronic iron poisoning

Explanation:
Chronic arsenic poisoning causes characteristic skin changes, including hyperkeratosis (especially on palms and soles) and a pattern of hyperpigmentation interspersed with small areas of normal or depigmented skin, described as 'raindrop' pigmentation.

================================================================================
Question 739 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
All are causes of acute pancreatitis except

Options:
  Alcohol
✓ Insect bite
  Gall stones
  Biliary stricture
  Mumps

Explanation:
The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol. Other causes include post-ERCP, trauma, hypertriglyceridemia, certain drugs, and infections like mumps. Scorpion stings (not insect bites in general) are a rare cause, but simple insect bites are not a recognized etiology.
