This is a cohort study design because it involves following a defined group of individuals (antenatal women, categorized by smoking status) forward in time to observe the development of an outcome (low birth weight).

================================================================================
Question 8 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher wanted to study the time sequence to prove the concept of causality. He started studying the healthy people. Researcher wanted to see if high fat diet consumption has any role in ischemic heart disease development. Which design of study should be preferred by the researcher?

Options:
  Case report
  Case series report
  Cross sectional
✓ Longitudinal
  Quasi experimental

Explanation:
A longitudinal study, which is essentially a prospective cohort study, is preferred when a researcher wants to establish a time sequence to prove causality by following healthy individuals over time to observe the development of disease in relation to their exposures.

================================================================================
Question 9 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Smoking leads to esophageal carcinoma. Alcohol intake is related to smoking and also has its role in esophageal carcinoma development. This factor can distort the results of the study which intends to prove an association between smoking and esophageal cancer. What type of effect is this?

Options:
✓ Confounding
  Dose response relation
  Multiple causation
  One to one relationship

================================================================================
Question 16 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 58 years female complaint of pain abdomen on workup there is 4 cm bilateral ovarian mass with septations were present on ultrasound, next step of management is:

Options:
  OCPS and anti-inflammatory
✓ Send tumor markers and decide accordingly
  Surgery
  Ultrasound guided aspiration
  Wait for three months and decide on follow up

Explanation:
In a postmenopausal woman with bilateral ovarian masses and septations, there is a higher suspicion for malignancy. The next crucial step is to obtain tumor markers (e.g., CA-125) to help assess the risk of malignancy and guide further management, which may include surgery.

================================================================================
Question 17 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question 18 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An adolescent girl with complaint of lower abdominal fullness, on and of pain came to OPD on ultrasound 10.8 cm ovarian mass was found. Serum LDH is raised. What preferred mode of treatment you still suggest?

Options:
  Cystectomy with radiotherapy
  Oophorectomy+ radiotherapy
✓ Surgery with preservation of uterus and normal ovary followed by chemotherapy
  Ultrasound aspiration followed by chemotherapy
  Total abdominal hysterectomy+ bilateral salpingectomy

Explanation:
Given the large ovarian mass in an adolescent, a raised LDH (which can indicate germ cell tumors like dysgerminoma), and the desire to preserve fertility, the preferred mode of treatment would be conservative surgery (e.g., unilateral oophorectomy or cystectomy) with preservation of the uterus and contralateral ovary, followed by chemotherapy if indicated by histopathology.

================================================================================
Question 19 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 years old patient came to OPD with ultrasound report which shows bilateral ovarian masses with increased vascularity, and septations.

✓ 10-15% if two 1st degree relative upto 40% risk
  22-25%
  40-50%
  1-2%

Explanation:
Approximately 10-15% of ovarian cancers are associated with an inherited genetic predisposition, such as BRCA1/2 mutations. The risk increases significantly with the number of affected first-degree relatives, potentially reaching up to 40% or more.

================================================================================
Question 20 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
There are different treatment modalities for cervical malignancy the decision is based on staging of CX cervix, we can proceed towards radical surgery before chemo and radio. Which of the following stage?

Options:
✓ Stage Ia and Stage Ib
  Stage 2a
  Stage 3a
  Stage 3b
  Stage 2b

Explanation:
Radical hysterectomy (radical surgery) is the primary treatment for early-stage cervical cancer, specifically Stage IA2 and Stage IB1/IB2, where the tumor is confined to the cervix or small enough to be surgically resectable.

================================================================================
Question 21 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

To prevent cervical cancer cervical screening program had been started. All women should be screened at the following age group:

Options:
  12-50 years
  15-60 years
✓ 25-64 years
  18-60 years
  20-64 years

Explanation:
Current international and national guidelines (e.g., WHO, CDC, ACOG) generally recommend cervical cancer screening for women starting around age 21 or 25 and continuing until age 64 or 65. The option '25-64 years' aligns well with these recommendations.

================================================================================
Question 22 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You are sitting in gynae clinic a patient para 6 has visited you with the report of cervical screening which showed moderate dyskaryosis with positive HPV testing. What will you do next?

Explanation:
A cervical screening report showing moderate dyskaryosis (moderate squamous intraepithelial lesion, or HSIL/CIN2) along with positive HPV testing indicates a significant abnormality requiring further investigation. The next step is a referral for colposcopy to visually examine the cervix and obtain targeted biopsies.

================================================================================
Question 23 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
56 years old para 7 presented with the complaint of post-menopausal spotting along with foul smelling discharge and also complaining of dysuria and urinary hesitancy along with lower abdominal pain, patient husband has been in gulf country for many years. On per speculum examination patient she has marked pallor and she is quite anxious. What is most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Menopause symptoms
  Pelvic inflammatory disease
✓ Cervical malignancy
  Cervical polyp
  Fibroid uterus

Explanation:
Post-menopausal bleeding, foul-smelling discharge, dysuria, and lower abdominal pain, especially with marked pallor and anxiety, are highly concerning symptoms for cervical malignancy in a 56-year-old. While other conditions can present with some of these, the combination strongly points to cancer until proven otherwise.

================================================================================
Question 24 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 47 years old para 5 presented to OPD with postcoital bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding and dysuria on per speculum examination there is fleshy growth that is involving the cervix biopsy was taken and histopathology came out to be cervical malignancy. How will you proceed further to stage the disease?

Options:
  Staging is done mainly radiologically
  CX cervix is staged surgically
✓ Staging is done clinically
  Staging is done histopathologically
  None of the above

Explanation:
Cervical cancer is primarily staged clinically, based on physical examination (including speculum and bimanual exam), colposcopy, biopsy results, and sometimes imaging like MRI for evaluation of local spread. This clinical staging system (FIGO staging) is universally accepted.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is drug of choice for pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia?

Options:
  Betamethasone
  Beclomethasone
✓ Dexamethasone
  Hydrocortisone
  Prednisolone

Explanation:
Dexamethasone is the drug of choice for antenatal treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in a pregnant female because it effectively crosses the placenta in its active form to suppress fetal adrenal androgen production, minimizing virilization of a female fetus.

================================================================================
Question 28 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old male patient taking medicine for treatment of BPH for 6 months. Which may cause reflex tachycardia or postural hypotension initial administration?

Options:
  Atenolol
  Hydrochlorothiazide
  Metoprolol
✓ Prazosin
  Verapamil

Explanation:
Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker commonly used for BPH. Its initial administration can cause significant vasodilation, leading to first-dose postural hypotension and compensatory reflex tachycardia.

================================================================================
Question 29 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that improve bone mineral density in a postmenopausal women?

Options:
  Clomiphene citrate
✓ Raloxifene
  Ormeloxifene
  Alendronate
  Both a & b

Explanation:
Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an estrogen agonist in bone, helping to improve bone mineral density and reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women.

================================================================================
Question 30 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Addiction of progestin for 10-12 days each month of estrogen replacement therapy in a postmenopausal women is recommended because of progestin.

Options:
  Block the increased risk of myocardial infarction due to estrogen endometrial
✓ Block the increased risk of endometrial carcinoma due to estrogen
  Reverse vulval atrophy occurring in postmenopausal women
  Both a & b
  All are correct

Explanation:
When estrogen replacement therapy is given to a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus, progestin is added for 10-12 days each month to counteract the estrogen's proliferative effect on the endometrium, thereby blocking the increased risk of endometrial carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 31 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 19 year old medical student presented with complaints of weight loss, polyuria and polydipsia. He was otherwise stable. His lab were as under: FBS 397mg/dL, HBAIC >15%. what will be the treatment strategy?

Options:
  Metformin
  Sulfonylureas
  DDP4 inhibitors
✓ Insulin
  Diet and life style modification

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia), very high Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS 397mg/dL), and extremely high HbA1c (>15%) are classic for newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes (or severe Type 2 diabetes with significant insulin deficiency). Insulin therapy is the immediate and most appropriate treatment strategy to control hyperglycemia and prevent diabetic ketoacidosis.

================================================================================
Question 32 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
35 years old female presented to emergency department with polyuria. She is diabetic for past 2 years and using glimepiride 4 mg. Now, she got pregnant with gestational amenorrhea of 4 months. Her labs are as under: RBS 250 msg/dL, HbA1C 7.4%. What will be the treatment strategy?

Options:
  Continue glimepiride and add Metformin
  Stop glimepiride and add GP-1 analogue
  Continue glimepiride and add DDP 4 inhibitor
✓ Stop glimepiride and switch to insulin
  Continue glimepiride and add insulin

Explanation:
Glimepiride (a sulfonylurea) is generally contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of fetal hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Given her pregnancy, elevated RBS, and HbA1c, the most appropriate treatment strategy is to stop glimepiride and switch to insulin, which is the preferred and safest medication for glycemic control in pregnant diabetic patients.

================================================================================
Question 33 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old male patient presented with costovertebral pain, palpable Mass & hematuria. He also complained with fever, weight loss & malaise. On biopsy of renal mass, the diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma was made. Which gene mutation is responsible for clear cell carcinoma?

Options:
✓ Loss of VHL
  Mutated BHD gene
  Mutated FH gene

================================================================================
Question 35 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 75 year old woman being investigated for recurrent UTIs (Proteus on culture report) has a stag horn calculus on CT scan what is the most likely Stone composition?

Options:
  Cystine
  Uric acid
✓ Struvite
  Calcium oxalate
  Hydrogen

Explanation:
Recurrent urinary tract infections, especially with urease-producing bacteria like *Proteus* species, create an alkaline urine environment that facilitates the formation of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones. These stones are known to form large casts of the renal pelvis, called staghorn calculi.

================================================================================
Question 36 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following symptoms is not related to urinary tract infection?

Options:
  Burning micturition
  Fever (low grade)
  Strong persistent urge to urinate

All the listed symptoms—burning micturition (dysuria), fever, a strong persistent urge to urinate (urgency), and cloudy urine—are common clinical manifestations associated with urinary tract infections.

================================================================================
Question 37 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
30 year old lady has obesity, infertility hirsutism and depression. What is the most likely condition she suffering from?

Options:
  Hypothyroidism
  Morbid obesity
✓ Polycystic ovary syndrome
  Polyglandular syndrome
  Type I diabetes mellitus

Explanation:
The constellation of symptoms including obesity, infertility, hirsutism, and often depression is highly characteristic of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age.

================================================================================
Question 38 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old female presented with solitary thyroid nodule. She complained of hoarseness of voice. On clinical examination cervical lymph node is also palpable. On thyroid scan it was cold solid nodule. FNAC of nodule showed intranuclear inclusions of aspirated cells. On biopsy the tumor cells showed orphan Annie eye nuclei. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Anaplastic carcinoma
  Follicular carcinoma
  Hurthle cell carcinoma
  Medullary carcinoma
✓ Papillary carcinoma

Explanation:
The presence of hoarseness of voice and palpable cervical lymph nodes (suggesting invasion/metastasis), a cold nodule on scan (more suspicious for malignancy), and especially the FNAC/biopsy findings of intranuclear inclusions and 'Orphan Annie eye' nuclei are pathognomonic for papillary thyroid carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 39 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient presented with weight loss, sweating, palpitation, lid lag, exophthalmos, Tachycardia tremors and a goiter. Upon thyroid scan, there appears to be increased intake of iodine. What is the pathogenesis of this disease?

Options:
  Infection
  Immune complex mediated
  Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Implied but option says 'Hashimoto's thyroid')
  Idiopathic
✓ Autoimmune mediated

Explanation:
The clinical presentation (weight loss, sweating, palpitations, lid lag, exophthalmos, tachycardia, tremors, goiter) and increased iodine uptake on thyroid scan are classic for Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies stimulate the TSH receptor, leading to excessive thyroid hormone production.

================================================================================
Question 40 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient who is presented with increased growth of skeletal and soft tissues, hypertension, arthritis, menstrual disturbance, and diabetes mellitus. When oral glucose administered, which one of the following level will increase? (Note: Context implies Acromegaly/GH excess where GH doesn't suppress, but question asks what will increase, normally insulin increases, but in acromegaly GH fails to suppress. The wording is tricky. Alternatively, it might be asking which level is elevated in the condition generally. IGF-1 is chronically elevated. Or perhaps 'fail to decrease' was intended for GH). Given options:

Options:
  Growth hormone
  Antidiuretic hormone
✓ Insulin like growth factor
  None of the above
  Both a & b

Explanation:
The symptoms (increased growth of skeletal/soft tissues, hypertension, arthritis, menstrual disturbance, diabetes) are characteristic of acromegaly, caused by excessive growth hormone (GH) secretion. While GH itself is elevated and fails to suppress, GH mediates most of its growth-promoting effects indirectly through the production of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 levels are chronically elevated in acromegaly and serve as a key diagnostic and monitoring tool. In an oral glucose tolerance test, while GH fails to suppress, insulin levels will increase in response to glucose. However, the question is likely asking about a chronically elevated marker related to the disease itself, which is IGF-1. If it's asking what *increases* after glucose, insulin would, but IGF-1 is the more direct measure of the disease's chronic activity.

================================================================================
Question 41 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Patient with diabetes have an increased risk for all of the following except?

Options:
  Cataracts
  Infection
  Increased atherosclerosis
  Peripheral Neuropathy
✓ Pancreatic carcinoma (Actually, diabetes is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but relative to complications, this is often the 'except' distractor in older contexts or implies a specific type. However, commonly: Diabetes increases risk of all A-D. Pancreatic Ca is also increased. Perhaps the intended answer is based on a specific context or error in question construction).
  Pancreatic carcinoma

Explanation:
Diabetes significantly increases the risk for cataracts, various infections, accelerated atherosclerosis, and peripheral neuropathy. While there is a recognized link and increased risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with long-standing diabetes, the question seeks the *least* likely or 'except' item in a list of common, direct diabetes complications. In many older medical education contexts or poorly constructed 'except' questions, pancreatic carcinoma might be intended as the answer, even though contemporary understanding recognizes diabetes as a risk factor for it. If the question implies direct complications of diabetes, pancreatic carcinoma is less direct than the others.

================================================================================
Question 42 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is true for papillary thyroid carcinoma?

Options:
✓ May have psammoma bodies
  Least common type
  Worst prognosis
  Associated with MEN-II
  Most common in elderly population

Explanation:
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and is characterized by distinct nuclear features (Orphan Annie eye nuclei, nuclear grooves, intranuclear inclusions) and often the presence of psammoma bodies (concentric calcifications). It generally has a good prognosis and is not typically associated with MEN-II (which is linked to medullary thyroid carcinoma).

================================================================================
Question 43 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The most common cause of hypothyroidism in third world countries in which of the following?

Options:
  Pituitary dysfunction
  Dequervain's thyroiditis
  Graves disease
  Hashimoto's thyroiditis
✓ Iodine deficiency

Explanation:
In many third-world (developing) countries, iodine deficiency remains the most common cause of hypothyroidism, leading to goiter and impaired thyroid hormone production.

================================================================================
Question 44 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Cushing's triad is;

Options:
✓ Increase ICP, HTN Bradycardia
  Increase ICP Hypotension Bradycardia
  Increase ICP, Hypotension , Tachycardia
  Increase ICP, HTN, Tachycardia
  Decrease ICP, HTN , Tachycardia

Explanation:
Cushing's triad is a clinical sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and consists of three components: hypertension (increased systolic blood pressure), bradycardia (slow heart rate), and irregular respiration.

================================================================================
Question 45 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The most common type of thyroid carcinoma is?

Options:
  Anaplastic carcinoma
  Follicular carcinoma

  Small cell carcinoma

Explanation:
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 80% of all thyroid malignancies.

================================================================================
Question 46 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which gland is under direct neural regulation of hypothalamus?

Options:
  Adrenal gland (Medulla) or Posterior Pituitary
  Anterior pituitary gland
  Parathyroid glands
✓ Posterior pituitary gland
  Thyroid gland

Explanation:
The posterior pituitary gland (neurohypophysis) is under direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic neurons synthesize oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and transport them down their axons for release from the posterior pituitary. The adrenal medulla is also under neural control, but typically from the sympathetic nervous system, not direct hypothalamic neurons for hormone release.

Explanation:
Iodine deficiency is a well-known cause of goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) as the thyroid attempts to compensate for insufficient iodine to produce thyroid hormones.

================================================================================
Question 48 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Hyperparathyroidism causes

Options:
  Heat intolerance
  High blood sugar
✓ Increased urination (Polyuria due to hypercalcemia)
  Headache
  Both a & b

Explanation:
Hyperparathyroidism leads to hypercalcemia, which can cause polyuria (increased urination) due to impaired renal concentrating ability. Heat intolerance and high blood sugar are not direct effects of hyperparathyroidism.

================================================================================
Question 49 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Most common cause of Cushing syndrome:

Options:
  ACTH Secreting tumor
  Adrenal adenoma
✓ Exogenous steroids
  Adrenal carcinoma
  All of the above

Explanation:
The most common cause of Cushing syndrome (exogenous Cushing syndrome) is the long-term, high-dose administration of exogenous glucocorticoids (steroids) for medical conditions.

================================================================================
Question 50 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient presents with polyuria and increase thirst serum glucose is not elevated serum osmolality is low. Upon water deprivation test. Which one of the following is correct?

Options:
✓ Problem in pituitary
  Problem in kidneys
  Patient with diabetes mellitus
  Serum ADH is high
  (Option missing or implied related to DI type)

Explanation:
The combination of polyuria, increased thirst, normal serum glucose, and low serum osmolality (implying dilute urine despite dehydration) points towards diabetes insipidus (DI). A water deprivation test differentiates between central DI (problem in pituitary/hypothalamic ADH production) and nephrogenic DI (problem in kidney response to ADH). If the problem is in the pituitary, it signifies central diabetes insipidus due to lack of ADH.

================================================================================
Question 51 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a common complication following thyroid (total thyroidectomy) surgery?

Options:
  Diabetes
  Hypertension
✓ Hypocalcemia
  Hypokalemia
  None of the above

Explanation:
Hypocalcemia is a common and potentially serious complication following total thyroidectomy due to inadvertent damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands during surgery, leading to temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism.

================================================================================
Question 52 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
15 year old female presented to emergency department in the state of coma and fever. She has air hunger and dehydrated her GCS is 9/15, pulse 100, BP 100/60, blood sugar level are 450 mg/dl. What is the best treatment option for this patient?

Options:
  Metformin
  Gliclazide
  Long acting insulin
✓ Hydration with saline & Humulin R (DKA protocol)
  DPP4 inhibitor

Explanation:
The patient's presentation (coma, fever, air hunger, dehydration, hyperglycemia (450 mg/dl), and low GCS) is classic for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The immediate and best treatment involves aggressive intravenous hydration with saline and intravenous regular insulin (Humulin R) according to DKA protocols to correct dehydration, hyperglycemia, and acidosis.

================================================================================
Question 53 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
30 year old diabetic patient presented with polyuria, burning micturition. Her blood glucose levels are 250 mg/dl despite on oral medications. She has this urinary complaints for the last few months. What are the best investigation plans for her management?

Options:
  Urine routine analysis/RBC
  Fasting blood glucose daily
  Blood culture, RBC
✓ Urine culture HbA1c, RBC (likely intended to include Urine R/E)
  Ultrasound abdomen pelvis

Explanation:
Given the patient's diabetic status, polyuria, and burning micturition (suggesting a urinary tract infection), the best investigation plan involves a urine culture (to identify infection), HbA1c (to assess long-term glycemic control which is poor), and urine routine examination (implied by RBC in the option for general urinary assessment).

================================================================================
Question 54 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young asthmatic previously taking exogenous steroids came to emergency with vomiting, abdominal pain, low BP, dry mucous membranes blood sugar 120mg/dl most likely DX is:

Options:
  Cushing syndrome
  Diabetes mellitus
  Diabetes insipidus
✓ Addisonian crisis
  None of the above

Explanation:
A patient on chronic exogenous steroids who presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, and dry mucous membranes (signs of volume depletion and shock), often with a relatively normal or slightly low blood sugar, is highly suggestive of an Addisonian crisis. This occurs when exogenous steroids are abruptly withdrawn or during stress, leading to acute adrenal insufficiency.

================================================================================
Question 55 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The most common cause of permanent congenital hypothyroidism is:

Options:
  Dyshormonogenesis
✓ Thyroid dysgenesis
  Iodine deficiency
  Defect of iodine transport
  Pendred syndrome

Explanation:
Thyroid dysgenesis, including aplasia, hypoplasia, or ectopy of the thyroid gland, is the most common cause of permanent congenital hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas.

================================================================================
Question 56 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one is not an appropriate treatment for graves disease?

Options:
  Beta blockers
  Surgical removal of thyroid gland
  Radio-active iodine
  Antithyroid drugs
✓ Thyroxin

Explanation:
Thyroxin (levothyroxine) is thyroid hormone replacement therapy used to treat hypothyroidism. Graves' disease is a hyperthyroid condition, so administering additional thyroid hormone (thyroxin) would exacerbate the condition and is thus not an appropriate treatment. Beta-blockers, surgery, radioactive iodine, and anti-thyroid drugs are all treatment options for Graves' disease.

================================================================================
Question 57 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old woman complained of post menopausal bleeding. On examination her cervix was eroded and ulcerative. Biopsy was taken and diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial neoplasm was made on the basis of nuclear changes along with cytoplasmic halos having perinuclear vacuoles termed koilocytic atypia. Which of the following is associated with koilocytic atypia?

Options:
  EBV
  High Ki-67
  High CEA level
✓ HPV protein E5
  Keratin formation

Explanation:
Koilocytic atypia (koilocytosis) is the cytopathic effect characteristic of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection on squamous epithelial cells. HPV proteins, including E5, are involved in the pathogenesis and cellular changes associated with the infection.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Question:
False virgin is who has.

Options:
✓ Elastic hymen
  No hymen
  Imperforated hymen
  Annular hymen
  Septate hymen

Explanation:
A 'false virgin' refers to a woman who has had sexual intercourse but whose hymen remains intact, often due to a highly elastic or resilient hymen that stretches rather than tears during penetration.

================================================================================
Question 61 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A habituated female (i.e female who had frequent sexual intercourse) shows torn hymen known as.

Options:
  Carunculae hymenalis
  Linea Nigra
✓ Carunculae myrtiformes
  Marginal hymen
  Imperforated hymen

Explanation:
In a female who has experienced multiple acts of sexual intercourse or childbirth, the torn remnants of the hymen can heal into small, fleshy nodules known as carunculae myrtiformes.

================================================================================
Question 62 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A female who had given birth to child exhibits only remnants of hymen known as.

Options:
  Carunculae hymenalis
  Linea Nigra
✓ Carunculae myrtiformes
  Marginal hymen
  Imperforated hymen

Question:
The spermatozoa in a case of sexual intercourse can be seen in vagina till .

Options:
✓ 1-7 days
  10 days
  2 weeks
  4 weeks
  8 weeks

Explanation:
Spermatozoa can typically be detected in the vagina for up to 1-7 days (approximately 24 hours to 7 days) after sexual intercourse, although motility rapidly decreases.

================================================================================
Question 64 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Sin of Gomorrah is.

Options:
✓ Anal coitus
  Buccal coitus
  Incest
  Lesbianism
  Indecent assault

Explanation:
The 'Sin of Gomorrah' is an archaic term often used to refer to acts of sodomy, particularly anal coitus.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Question:
The pregnancy caused by rape can be terminated under the following ground.

Options:
  Therapeutic
  Eugenic
✓ Humanitarian
  Social
  None

Explanation:
Termination of pregnancy resulting from rape is typically considered under humanitarian grounds, acknowledging the severe psychological trauma and violation experienced by the victim.

================================================================================
Question 66 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old women presents with hypertension, and metabolic alkalosis. She has no history of renal disease or heart failure. Her plasma renin activity is low and her serum aldosterone level is high. What is the most likely cause of her condition?

Options:
  Renal artery stenosis
✓ Aldosterone -producing adrenal adenoma
  Renin- producing tumor
  Ectopic aldosterone - secreting tumor
  Familial hyperaldosteronism type 1

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of hypertension, hypokalemia (leading to metabolic alkalosis), low plasma renin activity, and high serum aldosterone is classic for primary hyperaldosteronism. The most common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism is an aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndrome).

================================================================================
Question 67 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old women presents with abdominal pain and distension for the last two months. On physical examination, she has multiple angiofibromas on her face and ash-leaf spots on trunk. A pelvic examination reveals an enlarged uterus. Laboratory tests show normal renal function and negative pregnancy test. A pelvic ultrasound shows multiple cysts in both ovaries. A renal ultrasound shows multiple cysts in both kidneys and multiple solid masses in the cortex and medulla. A contrast enhanced CT scan confirms the presence of bilateral renal angiomyolipomas. Which of the following cells are most likely to be found in these tumors?

Options:
✓ Mature adipose cells
  Immature cartilage cells
  Malignant epithelial cells
  Eosinophilic granular cells
  Multiple giant cells

Explanation:
The constellation of angiofibromas, ash-leaf spots, renal cysts, and bilateral renal angiomyolipomas is highly characteristic of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Angiomyolipomas are benign tumors composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle, and adipose (fat) cells. Thus, mature adipose cells would be found.

================================================================================
Question 68 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 year old man presents with hematuria and a palpable Mass in lower abdomen. Cystoscopy reveals a large , irregular, and ulcerated tumor involving posterior Wall of urinary bladder. Biopsy shows a high grade urothelial carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation. What is the most likely stage of this tumor according to the TNM system?

Options:
  Ta
  T1
  T2
✓ T3
  T4 (Options implied/missing context, but T4 often used for 'most likely stage' questions with extensive involvement, however snippet cuts off)

Explanation:
A large, irregular, ulcerated tumor with extensive squamous differentiation, involving the posterior wall of the urinary bladder and likely extending beyond the bladder wall (implied by palpation and 'extensive squamous differentiation' often indicating aggressive features), suggests an advanced stage. T3 describes a tumor that has invaded the perivesical tissue (fat surrounding the bladder) but not adjacent organs, which aligns with significant local extension implied by the description and could manifest as a palpable mass.

================================================================================
Question 69 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 year old woman undergoes transurethral resection of a small papillary tumor in the bladder. Histologic examination shows a low grade urothelial carcinoma with thin fibrovascular cores and orderly arrangement of cells. Immunohistochemistry shows positive staining for CK20 in the superficial cells and negative staining for CK7 in the basal cells. What is the most appropriate diagnosis for this tumor?

Options:
  Papilloma
  Papillary urothelial neoplasm of the low malignant potential
✓ Low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma
  High grade papillary urothelial carcinoma
  Invasive urothelial carcinoma

Explanation:
The histological findings (papillary tumor, low grade, thin fibrovascular cores, orderly cells) are characteristic of a low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma. The immunohistochemistry pattern (CK20 positive superficial, CK7 negative basal) is also consistent with low-grade urothelial lesions.

================================================================================
Question 70 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In live person the kidney transplantation , what investigations you will not do?

Options:
  Blood grouping
  HLA
  RFTs
✓ Renin hormone
  Renal tract study

Explanation:
For live donor kidney transplantation, essential investigations include blood grouping, HLA matching, assessment of renal function (RFTs) in both donor and recipient, and a comprehensive renal tract study in the donor. Renin hormone levels are not a standard or necessary investigation for routine transplant workup, although they might be relevant in specific hypertension cases.

================================================================================
Question 71 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Neprorectomy is primarily indicated in which of the following conditions?

Options:
  Polycystic kidney disease
✓ Renal cell carcinoma
  Nephrolithiasis
  UTI
  Both c&d

Explanation:
Nephrectomy (surgical removal of the kidney) is primarily indicated for renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) as the main curative treatment. While it might be performed in some severe cases of polycystic kidney disease or complicated nephrolithiasis, it's the primary definitive treatment for RCC.

================================================================================
Question 72 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the primary treatment goal for small kidney stones that can be passed naturally?

Options:
  Surgical removal
✓ Pain management
  Prevention of future stones
  Advice to increase fluid intake
  None

Explanation:
For small kidney stones that are expected to pass spontaneously, the primary treatment goal is pain management. This involves analgesics to control the severe pain (renal colic) as the stone navigates the ureter. Increasing fluid intake is also advised to aid passage, and prevention of future stones is a long-term goal, but immediate pain relief is paramount.

================================================================================
Question 73 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Undescended testes is also referred to as

Options:
  Inguinal hernia
  Varicoele
✓ Cryptorchidism
  Hydrocele
  Both b& c

Explanation:
Cryptorchidism is the medical term for undescended testes, a condition where one or both testicles fail to descend into the scrotum.

================================================================================
Question 74 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following can cause urinary retention?

Options:
  Direct inguinal hernia
  Benign prostate hyperplasia
  Urethral structure
  Bladder stone
✓ All except A

Explanation:
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), urethral strictures, and bladder stones are all common causes of urinary retention by creating obstruction to urine flow. A direct inguinal hernia, while a mass, typically does not directly obstruct the urinary tract to cause retention.

================================================================================
Question 75 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is accurate regarding urine studies in nephrotic syndrome?

Options:
  A 2+ reading on urinalysis via dipstick represents 300 mg/dl of urinary protein or more, correlating with a daily loss of 3g or more
  The presence of 4 or more red blood cells per high -power field in urine sediment examination is required for a diagnosis of micro hematuria
  A measurement of 100-150 mg of total protein present in a 24-hour urine collection suggest early nephrotic syndrome
✓ A ratio of urine protein to urine creatinine>2g/g indicates nephrotic -range proteinuria
  None of the above

Explanation:
Nephrotic-range proteinuria is defined as a urine protein excretion of >3.5 g/day. A urine protein to creatinine ratio of >2g/g (or >3g/g in some contexts) is generally indicative of nephrotic-range proteinuria. A 2+ dipstick is roughly 100-300 mg/dL, but not directly correlating to >3g/day. Microhematuria is typically >3 RBCs/hpf.

================================================================================
Question 76 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In uncentrifuged sample of urine, definition of significant polyuria is.

Options:
  >3 leukocytes per high power field
  >10 leukocytes per high power field
  >10 leukocytes/cu mm
  >5 leukocytes/cu.mm
✓ None of the above

Explanation:
The question defines *polyuria*, which is increased urine output (typically >2.5-3 liters/24 hours). The options relate to pyuria (leukocytes in urine), not polyuria. None of the given options accurately define significant polyuria or even a standard threshold for pyuria in an uncentrifuged sample without additional context.

================================================================================
Question 77 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old female presents to the clinic with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), including dysuria, frequency, and cloudy urine. She has a history of penicillin allergy. The urine culture confirms the presence of Escherichia coli. Which antibiotic would be the most appropriate choice for treating her UTI?

Options:
✓ Ciprofloxacin
  Amoxicillin
  Trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)
  Doxycycline
  Erythromycin

Explanation:
Given the patient has a penicillin allergy and *E. coli* is a common cause of UTI, ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) is a highly effective and appropriate choice for treatment. Amoxicillin is a penicillin, and TMP-SMX can also have cross-reactivity with some sulfa allergies, although penicillin is specified. Doxycycline and erythromycin are generally not first-line for uncomplicated *E.coli* UTIs.

================================================================================
Question 78 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years adult man was brought to forensic medicine department who was said to be a victim of an unlawful sexual act sodomy. What is the most appropriate position for the examination of such case?

Options:
  Knee elbow position
✓ Left lateral position
  Lithotomy position
  Prone position
  Right lateral position

Explanation:
The left lateral (Sim's) position is often considered the most appropriate and comfortable position for the examination of the anal region in cases of alleged sodomy or sexual assault, allowing for proper visualization and collection of evidence.

================================================================================
Question 79 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A doctor was called by the prosecutor for cross examination during a court proceeding. The prosecutor questioned a physician about the way the abortion stick works during criminal abortion The acceptable answer is?

Options:
✓ Necrosis and infection of uterine wall
  Nerve stimulation of uterus
  Relaxation of Uterine Muscles
  Separation of placenta
  Uterine contraction

Explanation:
Abortion sticks used in criminal abortions are unsanitary and cause injury, leading to necrosis and infection of the uterine wall. This trauma and infection eventually lead to the expulsion of the fetus, but with severe risks to the woman.

================================================================================
Question 80 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young married woman who was 4 weeks pregnant but does not want to continue the pregnancy because of her studies. There is no health issues to the mother other wise However, her husband is also not willing to abort the baby. Aborting a fetus according to the above scenario in Pakistani law, is considered as?

Options:
✓ Criminal abortion
  Has to be decided in the court
  Optional abortion
  Therapeutic abortion
  Upon mutual family decision

Explanation:
In Pakistani law, abortion is generally considered permissible only to save the life of the pregnant woman or to provide necessary treatment. Terminating a pregnancy solely for reasons related to studies, without a medical indication for the mother's health and against the husband's wishes, would be considered a criminal abortion.

================================================================================
Question 81 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A wife of a young adult male reported to their family doctor that her husband is found to have abnormal sexual behaviors during intimacy. She said that her husband feels pleasure for being pained and frequently asks to torture and bite him. What type of sexual perversion is this?

Options:
  Bondage
  Exhibitionism
  Fetishism
✓ Masochism
  Sadism

Explanation:
Masochism is a sexual perversion characterized by deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from suffering physical or psychological pain, humiliation, or abuse, often at the hands of a sexual partner.

================================================================================
Question 82 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A middle age 12 weeks pregnant women on her routine checkup found out during ultra sound that she is having a double sac with two fetuses. Initially in early days of her pregnancy there was only one fetus and sac What is this condition called?

Options:
  Dizygotic twins
  Monochorionic dizygotic twins
  Monozygotic twins
  Secretion
✓ Superfetation

Explanation:
Superfetation is a rare phenomenon where a second, new pregnancy is established in a woman who is already pregnant. This would result in two fetuses of different gestational ages within the same uterus, usually with different sacs.

================================================================================
Question 83 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male patient presented with 30 mm renal pelvis stone. What treatment will you offer to patient?

Options:
  ESWL
  Conservation treatment
✓ PCNL
  URS
  Pyelolithotomy

Explanation:
For a large renal pelvis stone (30 mm = 3 cm), Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is generally considered the treatment of choice. ESWL (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy) is less effective for stones of this size, and URS (Ureteroscopy) is more commonly used for ureteral stones.

================================================================================
Question 84 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 years old male presented e hesitancy , intermittent urination and nocturia , has USG shows 40 grams prostate. What treatment will you advise to patient ?

Options:
  Uretheral catheterization
  Anticholinergies drugs
✓ Alpha blockage drugs
  TURP
  Antibiotics

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (hesitancy, intermittent urination, nocturia) are classic for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Alpha-blockers (alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists) are typically the first-line pharmacological treatment for BPH, as they relax the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow.

================================================================================
Question 85 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old male presented with actual urinary retention. Urethral catheterization tried in emergency department but no sucessful. What will be next stip of management ?

Options:
  Retrograde uretherogram
✓ Suprapubic catheterization
  Optical urethrotomy
  Urethroplasty
  Laparotomy

Explanation:
In a patient with acute urinary retention where urethral catheterization is unsuccessful (e.g., due to severe urethral stricture or other obstruction), the next immediate step in management is suprapubic catheterization to decompress the bladder and relieve the retention.

================================================================================
Question 86 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old male presented with painless hematuria with passage of clots, he is also having irritative lower urinary tract symptoms, and he is smoker for the last 40 years. What is probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Enlarged prostate
✓ Bladder tumor
  Bladder stone
  Urinary tract infection
  Urethral stricture

Explanation:
Painless gross hematuria with passage of clots, especially in an older male smoker with irritative lower urinary tract symptoms, is highly suspicious for bladder tumor (urothelial carcinoma of the bladder). Smoking is the leading risk factor.

================================================================================
Question 87 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 year old man was reffered for pink discolouration of his urine. Three days ago he complained of a sore throat and was given a course of amoxicillin and ibuprofen by the GP but those symptoms have resolved now. urine dipstick showed blood ++, protein +, nitrites negative. What is the most likely diagnosis:

Options:
  Crescentic glomerulonephritis
  Wegener's granulomatosis
✓ IgA nephropathy
  Post streptococcal Glomerulonephritis
  Nephrotic syndrome

Explanation:
The presentation of gross hematuria (pink urine) following a recent upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat), with blood and protein on dipstick but negative nitrites, in a young man is highly suggestive of IgA nephropathy. This condition often presents as synpharyngitic hematuria.

================================================================================
Question 88 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 14 years old boy presented with three days history of abdominal pain, rash on the trunk buttocks and legs, his blood pressure is 140/90. Laboratory investigations: CBC: Hb 12g/dl TLC 9000 PLT 320000 Random blood glucose 120mg/ dl Anti Nuclear Antibodies : Negative Urea: 100mg/dl Creatinine : 2mg/dl Chest Xrays : Unremarkable Urine RE: RBCs++ Protein++ Pus cells 2-4/hpr. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis
  IgA Nephropathy
✓ Henoch Schonlein syndrome
  SLE
  Minimal change disease

Explanation:
The classic triad of abdominal pain, palpable purpuric rash (especially on buttocks and legs), and renal involvement (hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria, elevated urea/creatinine) in a child is diagnostic of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), which is an IgA vasculitis.

================================================================================
Question 89 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Commonest cause of chronic Kidney Disease?

Options:
  Hypertension
✓ Diabetes mellitus
  Kidney stone
  SLE
  NSAIDs

Explanation:
Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide, leading to diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension is the second most common cause.

================================================================================
Question 90 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A boy with recurrent UTIs, who cann't pass urine in single stream, can have:

Options:
✓ Posterior urethral valves
  Horse shoe kidney
  Single kidney
  All of above
  None of above

Explanation:
In boys, recurrent urinary tract infections and an inability to pass urine in a single stream (indicating obstructive voiding) are highly suggestive of posterior urethral valves (PUV), which are congenital obstructive membranes in the male urethra.

================================================================================
Question 91 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old unmarried female presented in surgical OPD having painless lump in right upper outer quadrant of breast for last 3 months gradually increasing in size. Examination reveals hard mass, immobile attached to deeper tissue. What is likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Mammography
  Ultrasound breast
  Open biopsy
✓ FNAC
  MRI

Explanation:
For a suspicious breast lump (hard, immobile, attached to deeper tissue), particularly in a 45-year-old, tissue sampling is essential for diagnosis. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is a quick and less invasive initial biopsy technique to assess for malignancy. This would typically be part of a triple assessment including imaging.

================================================================================
Question 92 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male patient presented with infertility. When sperm ejaculate analysis was done it came to be azoospermia and when further investigated it was found that there is obstruction in the ejaculatory duct. Which hormonal essay is done in this case?

Options:
  Serum testosterone
  Serum prolactin
  Luteinsing hormone
  prostate specific antigen
✓ Follicle stimulating hormone

Explanation:
In a male patient with azoospermia due to ejaculatory duct obstruction (obstructive azoospermia), FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) levels are typically normal because the testes are still producing sperm (and inhibin B) and are responsive to FSH. Elevated FSH would suggest primary testicular failure, which is not the case here.

Question 93 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young lady is diagnosed with breast carcinoma. One of her aunt died of breast cancer and her elder sister has ovarian tumor. Which of the following gene should be tested for mutation in this patient?

Options:
  P53
✓ BRCA
  ERBB
  ER/PR
  (Option missing)

Explanation:
A strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer in first-degree relatives (aunt, sister) significantly increases the suspicion of a hereditary cancer syndrome. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most common genetic cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, making BRCA testing highly indicated.

================================================================================
Question 94 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year -old lady came with lumpy bumpy breast with breast pain during premenstrual time. If we take biopsy microscopy will reveal ...

Options:
✓ Cysts, fibrosis and adenosis
  Epithelial hyperplasia
  Invasive ductal carcinoma
  Invasive lobular carcinoma
  Ductal papilloma

Explanation:
The description 'lumpy bumpy breast with breast pain during premenstrual time' is classic for fibrocystic changes (also known as fibrocystic disease or condition) of the breast. Histologically, this benign condition is characterized by the presence of cysts, fibrosis, and adenosis.

================================================================================
Question 95 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a feature of benign prostatic hyperplasia?

Options:
  Urinary frequency
  Urinary urgency
  Hesitancy
  Straining and dribbling
✓ All of the above

Explanation:
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the enlargement of the prostate gland, which can compress the urethra and cause a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). These include storage symptoms like urinary frequency and urgency, as well as voiding symptoms like hesitancy, straining to urinate, and post-void dribbling. Therefore, all the options listed are features of BPH.

================================================================================
Question 96 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is not a treatment option for Prostate cancer?

Options:
  EBRT
  TURP
  Brachytherapy
  Orchiectomy
✓ Gleason score

Explanation:
EBRT (External Beam Radiation Therapy), Brachytherapy (internal radiation), and Orchiectomy (removal of testicles to reduce testosterone) are all treatments for prostate cancer. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) can be used to relieve urinary symptoms but is not a curative treatment for the cancer itself. The Gleason score is a grading system used to assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer from a biopsy sample; it is a diagnostic and prognostic tool, not a treatment.

================================================================================
Question 97 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old presented to surgical opd with history of 2x3 cm lump in right breast for 4 months how will you proceed to reach the diagnosis?

Options:
  Ultrasound breast
  Mammogram
  Core needle biopsy
✓ Tripple assessment
  None of the above

Explanation:
The standard of care for diagnosing a breast lump is the 'triple assessment'. This comprehensive approach includes three components: clinical breast examination, breast imaging (such as a mammogram and/or ultrasound), and a tissue sample for histology (like a core needle biopsy). Relying on only one of these methods is insufficient for a definitive diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 98 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old lady presented in opd with a 1x1 cm nodule over the scar of Modified radical mastectomy .she is a known case of carcinoma breast and underwent MRM 2 years back.how will you confirm or refute the diagnosis of recurrent carcinoma breast?

Options:
  Ultrasound Breast
  MRI Breast
  CT Scan Chest
✓ Biopsy
  None of the above

Explanation:
While imaging techniques like ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans can identify and characterize the nodule, a definitive diagnosis of cancer recurrence requires histological proof. A biopsy of the suspicious nodule is essential to examine the cells under a microscope and confirm whether they are malignant.

================================================================================
Question 99 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28 years old nulliparous lady with hirsuitism, oligomennorhoea and inability to conceive. She diagnosed as having polycystic ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound. "What is the correct option of her cancer in future?"

Options:
  Increased risk of breast cancer
  Increased risk of ovarian cancer
✓ Increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer
  Increased risk of large gut cancer
  None of them

Explanation:
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by chronic anovulation, which leads to prolonged exposure of the endometrium to estrogen without the opposing effects of progesterone. This unopposed estrogen stimulation can cause the endometrial lining to thicken excessively (endometrial hyperplasia), which is a precursor to endometrial cancer.

================================================================================
Question 100 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Ovarian artery is a branch of which main artery:

Options:
  Internal iliac artery
  External iliac artery
✓ Aorta
  Femoral artery
  Both C and D

Explanation:
The ovarian arteries are paired arteries that arise directly from the anterolateral aspect of the abdominal aorta, typically inferior to the renal arteries at the L2 vertebral level.

================================================================================
Question 101 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In uncentrifuged sample of urine, definition of significant pyuria is:

Options:
  >3 leukocytes per high power field
✓ >10 leukocytes per high power field
  >10 leukocytes/cu.mm
  >5 leukocytes/cu.mm
  None of the above

Explanation:
Pyuria, the presence of white blood cells (leukocytes) in the urine, is a sign of inflammation, typically due to a urinary tract infection. The standard definition for significant pyuria on microscopic examination of a urine sample is the presence of 10 or more leukocytes per high-power field (HPF).

================================================================================
Question 102 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
P7, post-menopausal for 3 years, presented in OPD with heavy P/V bleeding – on TVS, endometrial thickness is 10mm e- normal pelvic structure. What will be the next investigation to proceed for diagnosis?

Options:
  Hysteroscopy
  Pap smear
  Colposcopy
✓ Hysteroscopy direct Biopsy
  Cone biopsy

Explanation:
Postmenopausal bleeding with a thickened endometrium (>4-5 mm) requires urgent investigation to rule out endometrial cancer. Hysteroscopy allows for direct visualization of the uterine cavity, and a directed biopsy of the endometrium is the gold standard for obtaining a tissue sample for definitive histological diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 103 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is defined as a persistent and intense sexual interest in non-living objects or specifi body parts?

Options:
✓ Fetishism
  Voyeurism
  Exhibitionism
  Masochism
  Sadism

Explanation:
Fetishism, or fetishistic disorder, is a paraphilia characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either using non-living objects (e.g., shoes, clothing) or a highly specific focus on non-genital body parts.

================================================================================
Question 104 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which term refers to the practice of gaining sexual gratification by inflicting suffering or humiliation on a partner?

Options:
✓ Sadism
  Masochism
  Fetishism
  Voyeurism
  Exhibitionism

Explanation:
Sexual sadism involves deriving sexual arousal from the psychological or physical suffering of another person, who is a non-consenting partner or a consenting partner in the context of BDSM activities.

================================================================================
Question 105 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is NOT a typical sign of incest in forensic examinations?

Options:
  Physical injuries to the genital area
  Behavioral changes such as anxiety or depression
✓ Lack of evidence of recent sexual activity
  Presence of sexually transmitted infections
  Discrepancies in the child's sexual development

Explanation:
Incest involves repeated sexual abuse. While a single examination might not show evidence of *recent* activity, the long-term nature of the abuse often leads to physical signs (injuries, STIs, developmental issues) and significant behavioral changes. Therefore, a lack of evidence of recent activity does not rule out incest and is not a typical sign.

================================================================================
Question 106 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Keeping in mind the population pyramid of Pakistan. Which of the following features is most obvious?

Options:
  Low fertility
  Low mortality
  Increased life expectancy
✓ High dependency ratio
  Low sex ratio

Explanation:
Pakistan's population pyramid has a wide base, indicating a large population of children and young people, and a narrow top. This structure signifies high fertility and a large youth cohort. The dependency ratio (the ratio of non-working-age population to the working-age population) is high because the large number of children (under 15) depend on the smaller working-age population.

================================================================================
Question 107 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A child of 1 year presents with muscle wasting, loss of subcutaneous fat with no signs of edema and weight below 60% of WHO standard. The mother gives history of not giving weaning food properly to the child after six months of age. The likely diagnosis is:

Options:
  Kwashiorkor
✓ Marasmus
  Marasmus & kwashiorkor
  Under nutrition
  Vitamin B1 deficiency

Explanation:
Marasmus is a form of severe acute malnutrition caused by a deficiency in all macronutrients (calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats). It is characterized by severe muscle wasting, loss of subcutaneous fat, and a very low weight for height, without the presence of edema. The child's 'emaciated' or 'old man' appearance is a classic sign.

================================================================================
Question 108 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Mrs. XYZ is a 58-year-old, para 5+0, presents with complains of something coming out of vagina. On per vaginal examination she is having complete procidentia. Choose best treatment option:

Options:
✓ Vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair
  Sacro-colpopexy
  Manchester repair
  Colporrhaphy
  Ring pessary

Explanation:
Complete procidentia is a severe form of uterine prolapse where the entire uterus protrudes outside the vagina. In a 58-year-old, post-menopausal woman who is likely done with childbearing, the definitive and most effective surgical treatment is a vaginal hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) combined with pelvic floor repair (colporrhaphy) to correct the associated vaginal wall defects and provide support.

================================================================================
Question 109 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26-year-old woman diagnosed with mild endometriosis complains of severe menstrual pain. She is recommended a treatment to manage her symptoms and regulate her menstrual cycle. Which of the following is common first-line treatment for managing pain in endometriosis?

Options:
  Antibiotics
  Analgesics
✓ NSAIDS
  Oral Contraceptive pills
  Steroids

Explanation:
While analgesics (painkillers) in general are used, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are a cornerstone of first-line treatment for pain associated with endometriosis. They work by inhibiting prostaglandins, which are chemicals that cause uterine contractions and pain. Combined oral contraceptives are also a first-line option, but NSAIDs directly target the pain mechanism. (*Note: Options B and C are very similar, but NSAIDs are a more specific and standard first-line class for this condition*).

================================================================================
Question 110 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old woman is diagnosed with endometriosis. She was told endometrial-like tissue is growing outside the uterus. Which hormone primarily stimulates the growth of ectopic endometrial tissue in endometriosis?

Options:
  Androgens
✓ Estrogen
  Progesterone
  Progestins
  Testosterone

Explanation:
Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent condition. The ectopic endometrial-like tissue contains estrogen receptors, and its growth, proliferation, and the associated inflammation are primarily stimulated by estrogen during the menstrual cycle.

================================================================================
Question 111 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28-year-old woman presents with chronic pelvic pain that worsens during her periods and painful intercourse. She has also been trying to conceive for the past year without success. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Adenomyosis
✓ Endometriosis
  Pelvic inflammatory disease
  Polycystic Ovarian Disease
  Uterine Fibroids

Explanation:
The classic triad of symptoms for endometriosis is dysmenorrhea (painful periods), dyspareunia (painful intercourse), and infertility. The patient's presentation of chronic pelvic pain, which is cyclical and associated with intercourse, along with subfertility, makes endometriosis the most likely diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 112 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 76-year-old P4+2 presents in Gynae OPD with history of something coming out of vagina. She in Known diabetic , hypertensive and now currently suffering from pneumonia. She also complains of urinary urgency. On examination she has second degree U/V prolapse. The best management option for this patient at this moment is :

Options:
✓ Vaginal Ring pessary
  Pelvic floor exercises
  Vaginal hysterectomy
  Vaginal packing
  Antibiotics

Explanation:
Given the patient's advanced age and significant medical comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and an active infection - pneumonia), she is a poor candidate for surgery at this moment. A vaginal ring pessary is a non-surgical, conservative option that can be inserted into the vagina to provide support for the uterus and relieve the symptoms of prolapse. It is the safest and most appropriate initial management choice.

================================================================================
Question 113 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old female comes to emergency at 28 weeks of gestation with severe abdominal pain and fever. She was diagnosed to have a fibroid uterus previously. What is the most likely diagnosis.

Options:
  Calcification of fibroid
  Fatty degeneration
  Hyaline degeneration
✓ Red degeneration
  Sarcomatous degeneration

Explanation:
Red degeneration (or carneous degeneration) is a specific type of infarction that can occur in uterine fibroids, most commonly during pregnancy. It is caused by the fibroid outgrowing its blood supply, leading to hemorrhage within the fibroid. This presents with acute, severe abdominal pain, fever, and nausea, mimicking other abdominal emergencies.

================================================================================
Question 114 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old female presents to OPD with heavy menstrual bleeding and lower abdominal heaviness. C U/S she has a 5x6cm fibroid. Which one of the following is the most common type of fibroid?

Options:
  Broad ligament Fibroid
  Cervical Fibroids
✓ Intramural s
  Submucosal
  Subserosal

Explanation:
Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are classified by their location. Intramural fibroids, which grow within the muscular wall of the uterus (the myometrium), are the most common type. Subserosal fibroids grow on the outer surface, and submucosal fibroids grow into the uterine cavity.

================================================================================
Question 115 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 years old female presents to opd with heavy menstrual bleeding. She seems Pale and lethargic. He U/S shows multiple fibroids. She has been taking medication for the last 1 year. History shows a complete family. Most appropriate management is

Options:
✓ Complete workup and planned total abdominal hysterectomy
  GnRH analogue
  Laparoscopic myomectomy
  Myomectmy
  Reassurance and medical treatment

Explanation:
This patient is symptomatic (pale, lethargic, likely anemic from heavy bleeding), has failed medical management for a year, and has completed her family. Given these factors, a definitive surgical treatment is indicated. A total abdominal hysterectomy would resolve her symptoms permanently by removing the source of the bleeding (the fibroid-filled uterus).

================================================================================
Question 116 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16 years unmarried girl, presented to OPD with continuous Per vaginal bleeding for the past 20 days. She gave a history of menarche 2 years back associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and gums bleeding. Wh are the most relevant investigations?

Options:
✓ Bleeding and Clotting time
  Complete Blood Count
  MRI
  Pelvic U/S
  Thyroid Function Tests

Explanation:
The combination of heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and bleeding from another site (gums) in an adolescent is highly suspicious for an underlying bleeding disorder, such as von Willebrand disease or a platelet function defect. Therefore, investigating her coagulation system with bleeding time, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is the most crucial first step.

================================================================================
Question 117 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42 years old female,P5+0 with diagnosed submucosal fibroid of 4x4cm has been taking symptomatic treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding for 8 months. She presented to the OPD for definitive treatment however refused surgical intervention. Most appropriate treatment option would be.

Options:
  Danazol
  GnRH Analogue
  Laparoscopic myomectomy
  Mirena
✓ Uterine Artery Embolization

Explanation:
For a patient with a symptomatic fibroid who desires a definitive treatment but wishes to avoid surgery, Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) is an excellent option. UAE is a minimally invasive procedure where the blood supply to the fibroids is blocked, causing them to shrink and symptoms to improve. It preserves the uterus and is less invasive than a hysterectomy or myomectomy.

================================================================================
Question 118 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 wpmen -years-old p 4 presentedto OPD with complaints of excessive sweat and flushing of face mood swings for last 2 years she is not mensturating .her serum TSH levels are normal.she is very concern about her problem .what could be the cause for her problem?

Options:
  Hypothyroidism
✓ Hotflushes
  Tension/psychological disorder
  Premature ovarian failure
  None of the above

Explanation:
The patient's age (50), cessation of menstruation (menopause), and symptoms of sweating, flushing, and mood swings are classic signs of vasomotor symptoms of menopause, commonly known as hot flushes (or hot flashes). A normal TSH level helps to rule out a thyroid disorder as the cause.

================================================================================
Question 119 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 -years old women presented with decreased bone density and small bone fractures what is the line pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women?

Options:
✓ Bisphosphonates
  Calcitonin
  Hormone replacement therapy
  Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERMs)
  None of the above

Explanation:
Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, risedronate) are the first-line pharmacologic treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. They work by inhibiting osteoclast activity, which reduces bone resorption and helps to increase bone mineral density, thereby lowering the risk of fractures.

================================================================================
Question 120 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 women -years-old p 2 presented with secondary ammenorhea for last 2 years no history of an surgery or medical treatment .no history of any malignancy her s FSH level is more than 100 .she is diagno have premature ovarian failure .the most appropriate cause for her condition is?

Options:
  Chromosomal abnormality
  Hystrectomy
✓ Idiopathic
  Radiotherapy/chemotherapy
  None of the above

Explanation:
Premature Ovarian Failure (POF), also known as Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), is the loss of normal ovarian function before age 40. While it can be caused by genetic disorders, autoimmune diseases, or iatrogenic causes (like chemotherapy), in the majority of cases (up to 90%), a specific cause cannot be identified, and it is therefore classified as idiopathic.

================================================================================
Question 121 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is the most common type of ovarian cancer?

Options:
  Endometrioid carcinoma
  Germ cell tumor
✓ Serous epithelial carcinoma
  Stromal cell tumor
  None of the above

Explanation:
Ovarian cancers are broadly classified based on the cell type of origin. Epithelial ovarian cancers are the most common, accounting for about 90% of cases. Among the epithelial subtypes, serous carcinomas (specifically high-grade serous carcinoma) are the most prevalent, making up approximately 70-80% of all epithelial ovarian cancers.

================================================================================
Question 122 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65-year-old woman complains of a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary urine leakage. She reports needing to urinate frequently, including multiple times at night. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

Options:
✓ Detrusor overactivity
  Pelvic organ prolapse
  Postmenopausal atrophy
  Urethral sphincter incompetence
  None of the above

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of a sudden, compelling urge to urinate that is difficult to defer (urgency), often followed by involuntary leakage, along with frequency and nocturia, are the classic signs of Urge Urinary Incontinence. The underlying pathophysiology of this condition is detrusor overactivity, where the bladder muscle contracts involuntarily during the filling phase.

================================================================================
Question 123 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old woman with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer in her mother and sister is found to have a brca1 mutation. What is the best preventive strategy for her?

Options:
  Annual pelvic ultrasound
  Frequent ca 125 monitoring
  Hormonal therapy
✓ Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
  None of the above

Explanation:
A BRCA1 mutation confers a very high lifetime risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer. Surveillance with CA-125 and ultrasound has not been proven to be effective in detecting ovarian cancer at an early, curable stage. Therefore, the most effective risk-reducing strategy is a prophylactic (preventive) bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries), which can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 96%.

================================================================================
Question 124 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26-year-old woman presents to the gynae OPD with complaints of irregular periods, acne, and weight gain for last one year. She also complains of increased hair growth on her face and abdomen. On examination, her BMI is 32  kg/m2 , and her skin shows signs of acanthosis nigricans. She is worried about her fertility as she has been trying to conceive for the past 12 months .what is the best treatment for her

Options:
✓ Life style modification and weight loss
  metformin
  oral contraceptive pills
  ovulation induction
  None of the above

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms are classic for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). In overweight or obese women with PCOS who are seeking fertility, lifestyle modification, including diet, exercise, and subsequent weight loss, is the first-line treatment. Even a modest weight loss of 5-10% can restore ovulation, improve hormonal profiles, and increase the chances of spontaneous conception.

================================================================================
Question 125 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A- 28-year-old woman presents to the gynecology OPD she complains about irregular menstrual cycles. She says that her periods occur every 2-3 months and have been irregular for the past two years. She also complains of recent weight gain and increased acne. on examination, her BMI is 31  kg/m2 , and there is mild hirsutism on her face. Pelvic ultrasound shows multiple small cysts on both ovaries.the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Hypothyroidism
  Hyperprolactinemia
✓ Polycystic ovary syndrome
  Premature ovarian failure
  None of the above

Explanation:
The patient meets the classic Rotterdam criteria for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): oligo/anovulation (irregular periods), clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism), and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The combination of these features makes PCOS the most likely diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 126 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 34 year old woman has complaint of a white thick cottage cheese like discharge associated with vulval ching.She is a mother of 3 kids and denies any history of multiple sexual partners. Which treatment is the most uitable to relieve her complaints?

Options:
  Only reassurance
  Oral metronidazole
  Topical oestrogen
✓ Oral fluconazole
  Oral steroids

Explanation:
The description of a thick, white, 'cottage cheese-like' discharge accompanied by intense itching is the classic presentation of vulvovaginal candidiasis (a yeast infection). The most common and effective treatment is an antifungal medication, such as a single oral dose of fluconazole.

================================================================================
Question 127 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 46 year old woman presents with urine leakage whenever she sneezes, coughs, or lifts heavy objects. e is multiparous and has no other significant medical history. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Functional incontinence
  Overflow incontinence
✓ Stress urinary incontinence
  Urge incontinence
  None of the above

Explanation:
Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) is the involuntary leakage of urine that occurs with effort or exertion, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or lifting. It is caused by weakness of the pelvic floor muscles and urethral sphincter, which fails to withstand increases in intra-abdominal pressure. Multiparity is a common risk factor.

================================================================================
Question 128 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A well was present in a rural area where an unsanitary bore-hole latrine with lots of flies was present within 10 feet of distance. The disease more likely to be transmitted through drinking this well water is:

Options:
  Leishmaniasis
✓ Typhoid
  Dental caries
  Ancylostomiasis
  Trachoma

Explanation:
The close proximity of an unsanitary latrine to a well creates a high risk of fecal contamination of the water supply. Typhoid fever is a waterborne illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route through contaminated water and food.

================================================================================
Question 129 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An epidemic of gastroenteritis affected more than 500 people in a city. Samples of water were taken from different sites of the supply system. Bacteriological examination was positive for coli forms. Chemical analysis of water showed the presence of high fluoride, nitrate, chloride and ph of 6. Which content is suggestive of water born epidemic

Options:
  Nitrates
  Chlorides
  High pH
✓ Coli-forms
  Fluoride

Explanation:
Coliform bacteria, particularly E. coli, are indicator organisms. Their presence in a water supply strongly suggests recent fecal contamination and the potential presence of other disease-causing enteric pathogens. The identification of coliforms in the water during a gastroenteritis epidemic is the clearest evidence that the water is the source of the outbreak.

================================================================================
Question 130 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An out-break of scabies was reported in a Kachi abadi consisting of 500 people. The appropriate preventive measures suggested by you would be to:

Options:
  Filter the water
  Improve accessibility to water
  Destroy breeding sites of insects
✓ Chlorinate water
  Avoid bare footed watering of fields

Explanation:
*Correction & Clarification: The provided answer 'd. Chlorinate water' is incorrect for preventing scabies.* Scabies is caused by a mite and is spread through direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact and is associated with poor hygiene due to lack of water. The most appropriate measure among the choices, though indirect, would be **b. Improve accessibility to water**, as this would improve personal hygiene (bathing, washing clothes and bedding), which helps control the spread. Chlorination is for waterborne diseases, not skin mites. If we must choose from the flawed options, none are ideal, but water accessibility is the most relevant concept.

================================================================================
Question 131 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A water sample was taken from a source where catchment area included a large agricultural land. It was declared unfit for human consumption on account of raised concentration of a chemical. The likely chemical which has resulted in making this water unfit is:

Options:
  Iodine
  Calcium
  Zinc
  Chlorides
✓ Nitrite

Explanation:
Agricultural runoff from lands where nitrogen-based fertilizers are used is a major source of nitrate and nitrite contamination in water. High levels of nitrates/nitrites are a health concern, particularly for infants, as they can cause methemoglobinemia ('blue baby syndrome'). Therefore, nitrites are the most likely contaminant from an agricultural source to render water unfit.

================================================================================
Question 132 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A dental surgeon appointed in rural health centre reports an increased incidence of dental carries in the children of that area. The relevant preventive measure that he should suggest to the health authorities is:

Options:
✓ Fluoridation of water
  Chlorination of water
  Use of bacterial filter
  Use of boiled water
  Softening of hard water

Explanation:
Fluoride is a mineral that helps to strengthen tooth enamel, making it more resistant to decay caused by acids from bacteria. Community water fluoridation, the process of adjusting the amount of fluoride in drinking water to an optimal level for preventing tooth decay, is a well-established and effective public health measure to reduce the incidence of dental caries.

================================================================================
Question 133 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following statements is true about SMOG?

Options:
  SMOG is derived from the dust
  SMOG is derived only from fire
  SMOG is derived from water vapors
✓ SMOG is derived from both fog and smoke
  SMOG is derived only from fog

Explanation:
The term 'smog' is a portmanteau, a blend of the words 'smoke' and 'fog'. It refers to a type of air pollution, originally used to describe the mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide from coal burning in cities, which would mix with natural fog.

Question 134 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A survey on air pollution was conducted in an urban area to determine the major contaminant in air. The major contaminant estimated in all air pollution is:

Options:
  Grit and dust
  Sulphur dioxide
✓ Carbon monoxide
  Nitrogen dioxide
  Smoke index

Explanation:
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels. The primary source of CO in urban areas is vehicle exhaust. Due to the high volume of traffic, it is typically the most abundant air pollutant by mass in urban environments.

================================================================================
Question 135 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Increased levels of air pollution results mainly in problems of which system?

Options:
  Soil erosion
  GIT Problems
✓ Respiratory problems
  Endocrine problems
  Sea erosion

Explanation:
Air pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides are inhaled directly into the lungs. This exposure can trigger or exacerbate a wide range of respiratory problems, including asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and lung cancer, making the respiratory system the most directly and commonly affected system.

================================================================================
Question 136 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Who has responsibility for health and safety regarding waste management at your place of work?

Options:
  The patients
  Employees
  Employers, employees
✓ Everyone at your place of work
  Only Head of Institution

Explanation:
Health and safety in the workplace, including waste management, is a shared responsibility. While employers have a legal duty to provide a safe environment and proper systems, employees have a responsibility to follow procedures and act safely. Ultimately, everyone in the workplace, including management, staff, and even visitors or patients, has a role to play in maintaining a safe environment.

================================================================================
Question 137 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Where would you put a syringe after use?

Options:
  Pharma basket
✓ Sharps container
  Gray tote/yellow basket
  Red basket
  Green basket

Explanation:
Used syringes, needles, and other sharp medical instruments must be disposed of immediately in a designated sharps container. These containers are made of puncture-resistant plastic to prevent needlestick injuries and ensure the safe containment and disposal of potentially infectious waste.

================================================================================
Question 138 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Select the common route of transmission of HIV from one person to another?

Options:
✓ Exposure to contaminated blood and blood products
  Using and sharing the same swimming pool
  Using shared utensils
  Hand shaking
  Sharing clothes

Explanation:
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is transmitted through specific bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Major routes of transmission include unprotected sexual contact, sharing contaminated needles for injecting drugs, and exposure to contaminated blood and blood products. Casual contact like sharing utensils, handshaking, or swimming pools does not transmit the virus.

================================================================================
Question 139 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The changes in the size of population are indicated by five stages of demographic transition. Pakistan is currently in the:

Options:
  First stage
✓ Third stage
  Second stage
  Fourth stage
  Fifth stage

Explanation:
Pakistan is generally considered to be in the third stage of the demographic transition model. This stage is characterized by a declining birth rate and a low death rate. While the death rate has fallen due to improvements in healthcare and sanitation, birth rates are also beginning to fall due to increased education, access to contraception, and urbanization, but the population is still growing.

================================================================================
Question 140 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Population size is determined by fertility, mortality and migrations. A researcher concluded that Pakistan's population is increasing on account of high fertility which measure did he rely upon the most to conclude this?

Options:
  Growth rate
  Crude birth rate
  Natural increase rate
✓ Total fertility rate
  General fertility rate

Explanation:
The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is the best indicator of current fertility levels. It represents the average number of children a woman would have in her lifetime if she were to experience the current age-specific fertility rates. A TFR above the replacement level of 2.1 indicates a growing population due to high fertility, which is the case in Pakistan.

================================================================================
Question 141 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The number of daughters a new born girl will bear during her life time assuming fixed age specific fertility and mortality rate, refers to which one of the following?

Options:
  Age specific fertility rate
  Birth rate
✓ Net reproduction rate
  Total fertility rate
  General fertility rate

Explanation:
The Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) is a refined measure of fertility that indicates the average number of daughters that would be born to a female if she passed through her lifetime conforming to the age-specific fertility and mortality rates of a given year. An NRR of 1 indicates that each generation of women is exactly replacing itself.

================================================================================
Question 142 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Many women in a country are educated, independent and they work for earning their lively hood too. When the number of males are expressed in relation with 100 females this is:

Options:
✓ Sex ratio
  Sex rate
  Dependency ratio
  Literacy rate
  Working women ratio

Explanation:
The sex ratio is a demographic measure defined as the number of males per 100 females in a population. It is a basic tool used to describe the composition of a population.

================================================================================
Question 143 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
When total number of live births are expressed against the midyear population at a given place and during a given period. We are referring:

Options:
  General fertility rate
✓ Crude birth rate
  Total fertility rate
  Specific birth rate
  Gross reproductive rate

Explanation:
The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) is the simplest measure of fertility. It is calculated as the total number of live births in a specific year divided by the total mid-year population of that same year, and it is usually expressed per 1,000 people.

================================================================================
Question 144 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Hameed, Sara and Saima were born in the same year, they were neighbors and very close friends too. It was just a coincidence that their parents also got married about the same time. The most likely reason for the admission in the same class is:

Options:
✓ Birth cohort
  Marriage cohort of parents
  Friendship
  Neighborhood
  School accessibility

Explanation:
A birth cohort is a group of people who were born during the same period (in this case, the same year). School admissions are based on age, which is determined by the year of birth. Therefore, being part of the same birth cohort is the fundamental reason they would all be admitted to the same class level at the same time.

================================================================================
Question 145 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which part of the nephron is primarily responsible for the reabsorption of water and solutes from the filtrate?

Options:
  Bowman's capsule
  Collecting duct
  Distal convoluted tubule
  Loop of Henle
✓ Proximal convoluted tubule

Explanation:
The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is where the majority of reabsorption occurs in the nephron. Approximately 65-70% of the filtered water, sodium, and chloride, and nearly 100% of the filtered glucose, amino acids, and vitamins are reabsorbed back into the blood from the filtrate in the PCT.

================================================================================
Question 146 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which hormone is primarily responsible for regulating sodium and potassium balance in the kidneys?

Options:
  Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
✓ Aldosterone
  Erythropoietin
  Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
  None of the above

Explanation:
Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. It acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron to increase the reabsorption of sodium from the filtrate into the blood and to increase the secretion of potassium from the blood into the filtrate for excretion. This action is crucial for regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance.

================================================================================
Question 147 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which hormone is primarily responsible for regulating the body's metabolism?

Options:
  Adrenaline
  Cortisol
  Insulin
✓ Thyroxine
  Vasopressin

Explanation:
Thyroxine (T4), and its more active form triiodothyronine (T3), are thyroid hormones that play a crucial role in regulating the body's basal metabolic rate (BMR). They affect nearly every cell in the body, influencing the rate at which the body uses energy, produces heat, and consumes oxygen.

================================================================================
Question 148 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year female patient presents with a renal mass. Histological examination reveals large polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm and delicate vasculature. This finding is most consistent with which type of renal tumor.

Options:
  Angiomyolipoma
  Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
✓ Clear cell renal cell carcinoma
  Papillary renal cell carcinoma
  Wilms tumor

Explanation:
The classic histological description of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common type of kidney cancer, is nests of large polygonal cells with abundant clear cytoplasm (due to high glycogen and lipid content that washes out during processing) and a rich, delicate network of blood vessels (often described as a 'chicken-wire' vasculature).

================================================================================
Question 149 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 year female patient undergoes transurethral resection of a small papillary tumor in the bladder. Histologic examination shows a low grade urothelial carcinoma with thin fibrovascular cores and orderly arrangement of cells. Immunohistochemistry shows positive staining for CK20 in the superficial cells and negative staining for CK7 in the basal cells. What is the most appropriate diagnosis for this tumor.

Options:
  High grade papillary urothelial carcinoma
  Invasive urothelial carcinoma
✓ Low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma
  Papilloma
  Papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential

Explanation:
The histological features described—a papillary architecture with thin fibrovascular cores and an orderly arrangement of cells with minimal atypia—are characteristic of a Low-Grade Papillary Urothelial Carcinoma. This diagnosis is further supported by the typical immunohistochemical staining pattern of CK20 positivity in the superficial 'umbrella' cells.

================================================================================
Question 150 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old woman presents with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. A laparoscopy reveals the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue on the ovaries and pelvic peritoneum. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Adenomyosis.
✓ Endometriosis.
  Ovarian cyst.
  Pelvic inflammatory disease.
  Uterine fibroids.

Explanation:
The definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is made by direct visualization and histological confirmation of endometrial-like tissue (glands and stroma) outside the uterine cavity. The patient's classic symptoms (pelvic pain, painful periods, painful intercourse) combined with the laparoscopic findings confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis.

================================================================================
Question 151 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with vaginal bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound reveals an endometrial thickness of 8 mm, What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Atrophic vaginitis.
  Cervical cancer.
✓ Endometrial hyperplasia.
  Ovarian cancer.
  Valvular cancer.

Explanation:
In a postmenopausal woman, any vaginal bleeding is abnormal and must be investigated. An endometrial thickness of more than 4-5 mm is considered abnormal and, in the setting of bleeding, is highly suspicious for endometrial pathology. Endometrial hyperplasia (abnormal thickening of the uterine lining) is a common cause and is a precursor to endometrial cancer.

================================================================================
Question 152 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old woman presents with a history of irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, and recent weight gain. On examination, she has acne and multiple small cysts on her ovaries noted on ultrasound. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Androgen insensitiviy syndrome.
  Cushing syndrome.
  Hyperthyroidism.
  Hyperprolactinemia .
✓ Polycystic Ovarian syndrome .

Explanation:
The patient's clinical picture includes key features of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) according to the Rotterdam criteria: oligo/anovulation (irregular cycles), clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne), and polycystic morphology of the ovaries on ultrasound. This combination makes PCOS the most probable diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 153 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the typical appearance of a chancre in primary syphilis?

Options:
  Painful, erythematous ulcer
  Small, vesicular lesion
  Large, necrotic ulcer
✓ Painless, indurated ulcer
  Rash with pustules

Explanation:
The hallmark lesion of primary syphilis is the chancre, which typically appears at the site of inoculation. The classic description is a single, clean-based, sharply demarcated, painless ulcer with a firm, indurated (hardened) border.

================================================================================
Question 154 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In men, gonorrhea can lead to which of the following complications if left untreated?

Options:
✓ Epididymitis
  Prostate cancer
  Peyronie's disease
  Testicular torsion
  Seminal vesiculitis

Explanation:
If an untreated gonococcal infection ascends from the urethra, it can infect the epididymis, the coiled tube at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm. This condition, known as epididymitis, causes testicular pain and swelling and can lead to infertility if not treated promptly.

================================================================================
Question 155 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12 year old boy presented with history of a sore throat followed by hematuria. Renal biopsy revealed diffuse proliferative pattern and immunofluorescence showed coarse granular deposits in mesangium and along capillary loops for IgG and C3. Which serological test would support the diagnosis?

Options:
  Antidouble stranded DNA
  Anti-GBM antibodies
  Antimitochondrial antibodies
  Antinuclear antibodies
✓ Antistreptolysin O antibodies

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of hematuria following a sore throat, along with the biopsy findings, is classic for Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN). This condition is caused by an immune response to a recent infection with group A streptococcus. An elevated Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is a serological test that provides evidence of this recent streptococcal infection, thus supporting the diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 156 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following immunohistochemical stains would be most helpful for distinguishing DCIS from an invasive breast carcinoma with a cribriform growth pattern?

Options:
  CK7
  Estrogen receptor
  Her2
  Progesterone receptor
✓ P63

Explanation:
In normal breast ducts and in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), a layer of myoepithelial cells surrounds the epithelial cells. In invasive carcinoma, this myoepithelial layer is absent as the cancer cells have broken through the basement membrane. P63 is an immunohistochemical marker that specifically stains the nuclei of myoepithelial cells. Therefore, the presence of p63 staining would indicate DCIS, while its absence would support a diagnosis of invasive carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 157 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old male presented with history of fever, significant weight loss, painfull micturition, hematuria and flank mass, his Hb is 18. What could be the possible pathology associated with this condition?

Options:
  Angiomyolipoma
  Hepatocellular carcinoma
  Polycystic kidney disease
✓ Renal cell carcinoma
  Rhabdomyosarcoma

Explanation:
This patient presents with a classic triad for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC): flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable abdominal mass. The constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss) are also common. Importantly, RCC can cause paraneoplastic syndromes, including erythrocytosis (high hemoglobin/hematocrit) due to ectopic production of erythropoietin by the tumor. A Hb of 18 g/dL is elevated and fits this picture.

================================================================================
Question 158 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
PAP smear done which shows dysplasia but basement membrane is intact what is associated with this

Options:
✓ Carcinoma in situ
  Hyperplasia
  Invasion of adjacent tissue
  Invasion of basement membrane
  Necrosis

Explanation:
The term 'dysplasia' refers to abnormal cell changes. When these changes are severe and involve the full thickness of the epithelium but have not breached the underlying basement membrane, the condition is called Carcinoma In Situ (CIS). It is a pre-invasive stage of cancer, meaning the abnormal cells are confined to their original location.

================================================================================
Question 159 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
What is a defining feature of minimal change disease?

Options:
  Blunting of the villi on light microscopy
✓ Effacement of the foot processes on electron microscopy
  Hyperplastic changes
  Segmental sclerosis on light microscopy
  Slight visible changes of the glomeruli on light microscopy

Explanation:
Minimal Change Disease (MCD) is a major cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. It is named 'minimal change' because the glomeruli appear normal under light microscopy. The pathognomonic finding, visible only on electron microscopy, is the widespread effacement (fusion or flattening) of the podocyte foot processes.

================================================================================
Question 160 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A woman with a history significant for lupus is found to have 2.3 grams of protein in her urine each day. In investigation you find wire looping of the capillaries on light microscopy. Which of the following tops your erential?

Options:
✓ Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis
  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
  IgA nephropathy
  Nephropathy
  Rapidly progressive Glomerulonephritis

Explanation:
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) can cause several types of kidney disease (lupus nephritis). Diffuse Proliferative Glomerulonephritis (Class IV Lupus Nephritis) is a severe form characterized by significant proteinuria. The classic finding on light microscopy is diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary walls due to subendothelial immune complex deposits, creating a 'wire loop' appearance.

================================================================================
Question 161 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 31-year-old woman, who has two healthy children, notes that she has had no menstrual periods for the 6 months, but she is not pregnant and takes no medications. Within the past week, she has noted some production from her breasts. She has been bothered by headaches for the past 3 months. After nearly ng a bus while changing lanes driving her vehicle, she is concerned with her vision. An optometrist finds her ral vision to be reduced. On physical examination she is afebrile and normotensive. Which of the following ratory test findings is most likely to be present in this woman?

Options:
✓ Hyperprolactinemia
  Hyponatremia
  Increased serum cortisol
  Increased serum alkaline phosphatase
  Lack of growth hormone suppression

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of amenorrhea (no periods), galactorrhea (breast milk production), headaches, and peripheral vision loss (bitemporal hemianopsia) strongly suggest a pituitary adenoma, specifically a prolactinoma. This tumor secretes excess prolactin, leading to hyperprolactinemia, which causes the hormonal and mass effect symptoms described.

================================================================================
Question 162 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28-year-old woman has had difficulty concentrating at work for the past month. She is constantly ing up and walking around to visit co-workers. She complains that the work area is too hot. She seems ous and often spills her coffee. She has been eating more but has lost 5 kg in the past 2 months. On physical nination her temperature is 37.5°C, pulse 108/minute, respiratory rate 24/minute, and blood pressure /85 mm Hg. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be present in this woman?

Options:
  Decreased catecholamines
  Decreased iodine uptake
  Decreased plasma insulin
✓ Decreased TSH
  Increased ACTH

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms—heat intolerance, anxiety, weight loss despite increased appetite, and tachycardia—are classic signs of hyperthyroidism. In primary hyperthyroidism (the most common cause, e.g., Graves' disease), the thyroid gland produces excessive T3 and T4. This high level of thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback on the pituitary gland, suppressing the release of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Therefore, a decreased TSH level is expected.

================================================================================
Question 163 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes and hypertension presents with fatigue, edema, and reased urine output. Laboratory tests reveal elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. alysis shows proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Which renal function test is most useful in assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in this patient?

Options:
  Serum Creatinine
  Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
✓ Creatinine Clearance
  Urine Protein-to-Creatinine Ratio
  Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)

Explanation:
While serum creatinine is used to estimate GFR, Creatinine Clearance is a more direct measurement. It assesses the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit of time by comparing the creatinine level in a 24-hour urine sample to the serum creatinine level. This provides a better quantitative assessment of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

================================================================================
Question 164 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old male presents with hypertension, hematuria, and flank pain. His family history is significant r kidney disease in his father and brother. An ultrasound of the abdomen reveals multiple cysts in both dneys. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute Glomerulonephritis
  Chronic Pyelonephritis
  Medullary Sponge Kidney
  Renal Cell Carcinoma
✓ Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease

Explanation:
The presentation of hypertension, flank pain, and hematuria, combined with a strong family history (father and brother affected) and ultrasound findings of bilateral multiple kidney cysts, is the classic picture of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). It is one of the most common inherited kidney disorders.

================================================================================
Question 165 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Physical examination veals dry skin and a puffy face. Laboratory tests show elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and w free thyroxine (T4) levels. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Addison's disease.
  Cushing's syndrome.
  Hyperthyroidism.
✓ Hypothyroidism.
  Pheochromocytoma.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and dry skin are classic for hypothyroidism. The diagnosis is confirmed by the lab results: low levels of thyroid hormone (free T4) and a high TSH level, which indicates the pituitary gland is trying to stimulate a failing thyroid gland (primary hypothyroidism).

================================================================================
Question 166 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old woman reports sudden weight gain, a round face, and purple striae on her abdomen. She s a history of hypertension and osteoporosis. Laboratory tests show elevated serum cortisol levels that are t suppressed by low-dose dexamethasone. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Addison's disease.
  Acromegaly.
✓ Cushing's syndrome.
  Hypothyroidism.
  Hyperthyroidism.

Explanation:
This patient's signs and symptoms—central obesity, 'moon face', purple striae, hypertension, and osteoporosis—are hallmark features of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol. The failure to suppress cortisol with a low-dose dexamethasone test confirms the diagnosis of hypercortisolism.

================================================================================
Question 167 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which condition is associated with an overproduction of growth hormone in adults?

Options:
✓ Acromegaly.
  Addison's disease.
  Cushing's syndrome.
  Gigantism.
  Hyperthyroidism.

Explanation:
Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results from excess growth hormone (GH) production by the pituitary gland in adulthood, after the fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates. This leads to the characteristic enlargement of hands, feet, and facial features. Gigantism is the result of excess GH before the growth plates have closed.

================================================================================
Question 168 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a key provision of the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) in many jurisdictions?

Options:
  Allowing the sale of organs to individuals in need of transplantation
✓ Permitting organ donation only from deceased individuals with a prior written consent
  Mandating that organ transplant centers are for-profit institutions
  Requiring a waiting period of 6 months before organ donation can be performed
  Allowing organ donation from individuals with a history of chronic illness without restrictions

Explanation:
Human Organ Transplant Acts (HOTA) are legislation designed to regulate organ donation and transplantation. A fundamental principle of these acts worldwide is the prohibition of the commercial sale of organs. They establish legal frameworks for both living and deceased donation, typically requiring explicit consent (opt-in) or presumed consent (opt-out), and set up regulatory bodies to oversee the process ethically and equitably. Option B reflects the consent principle often found in these acts.

================================================================================
Question 169 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a common cause of erectile dysfunction (impotence) in males?

Options:
✓ Psychological stress
  Testicular cancer
  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
  Hypospadias
  Endometriosis

Explanation:
Erectile dysfunction has both physical and psychological causes. Psychological factors such as stress, anxiety (particularly performance anxiety), depression, and relationship problems are very common contributors to ED, especially in younger men. These factors can interfere with the brain signals necessary to initiate and maintain an erection.

================================================================================
Question 170 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Sterility in males is most commonly due to which of the following conditions?

Options:
✓ Azoospermia
  Cryptorchidism
  Orchitis
  Epididymitis
  Gynecomastia

Explanation:
Sterility is the inability to cause pregnancy. Azoospermia, the complete absence of sperm in the ejaculate, is a direct cause of sterility. While conditions like cryptorchidism, orchitis, and epididymitis can *lead* to azoospermia or severe oligospermia (low sperm count), azoospermia itself is the end-point condition that defines sterility in this context.

================================================================================
Question 171 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Virginity testing is controversial because:

Options:
  It is scientifically inaccurate
  It can cause psychological harm
  It is a violation of human rights
  It can lead to social stigmatization
✓ All of the above

Explanation:
Virginity testing is widely condemned by international bodies like the WHO and UN. It has no scientific merit, as the state of the hymen is not a reliable indicator of sexual intercourse. The practice is a violation of human rights, particularly for women and girls, can be physically and psychologically traumatic, and reinforces discriminatory gender stereotypes, often leading to severe social stigma.

================================================================================
Question 172 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a commonly accepted physical sign of virginity in females?

Options:
✓ Presence of a hymen
  Presence of labia minora
  Tightness of the vaginal orifice
  Absence of pubic hair
  Cervical position

Explanation:
Historically and culturally, the presence of an intact hymen has been considered a sign of virginity. However, this is a misconception. The hymen is a membrane that can tear for many reasons other than intercourse (e.g., sports, tampon use), and some women are born without a prominent hymen. Despite being scientifically unreliable, it remains a commonly, though incorrectly, accepted sign in many societies.

================================================================================
Question 173 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a common method of detecting a recent abortion in forensic examinations?

Options:
  Serum progesterone levels
✓ Pelvic ultrasound
  Urine pregnancy test
  Hysteroscopy
  Blood type and crossmatch

Explanation:
In a forensic context to detect a *recent* abortion, a pelvic ultrasound is a key non-invasive tool. It can identify retained products of conception, assess the state of the uterus (e.g., thickened endometrium, signs of instrumentation), and detect complications like perforation or hematoma, providing evidence suggestive of a recent pregnancy termination.

================================================================================
Question 174 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In forensic terms, which of the following can help differentiate between a spontaneous abortion and an induced abortion?

Options:
  The presence of fetal parts in the uterus
✓ History of medical or surgical procedures
  Maternal blood group
  Chromosomal analysis of the fetus
  Presence of fetal heartbeat

Explanation:
Forensically, the key differentiator is often evidence of intervention. A history of or physical evidence of surgical procedures (e.g., cervical trauma from instruments) or the detection of abortifacient drugs in the mother's system points towards an induced abortion. Spontaneous abortions typically lack such evidence of external intervention.

================================================================================
Question 175 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old man presents with symptoms of erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and fatigue. His lab results show low serum testosterone levels. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment option?

Options:
  Dexamethasone
  Estradiol
  Finasteride
✓ Testosterone replacement therapy
  Sildenafil

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (ED, low libido, fatigue) coupled with laboratory confirmation of low testosterone indicate clinical hypogonadism. The most direct and appropriate treatment for this condition is Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT), which aims to restore testosterone levels to the normal range, thereby alleviating the symptoms.

================================================================================
Question 176 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old woman with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is experiencing irregular menstrual cycles nd excessive facial hair. Which medication is most likely to help with both her menstrual irregularities and irsutism?

Options:
  Levonorgestrel
  Methandrostenolone
✓ Oral contraceptive pills containing ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone acetate
  Tamoxifen
  Testosterone enanthate

Explanation:
Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are a first-line treatment for managing PCOS symptoms in women not seeking pregnancy. They regulate the menstrual cycle by providing consistent hormone levels. Formulations containing an anti-androgen like cyproterone acetate are particularly effective at treating hirsutism and acne by blocking the effects of excess androgens.

Question 177 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
DW is a patient with type 2 diabetes who has a blood glucose of 400 mg/dL today at his office visit. The physician would like to give some insulin to bring the glucose down before he leaves the office. Which of the following would lower the glucose in the quickest manner in DW?

Options:
✓ Insulin aspart.
  Insulin glargine.
  NPH Insulin.
  Regular Insulin.
  Metformin

Explanation:
Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analog. It has a very fast onset of action, typically within 10-20 minutes, with a peak effect at 1-3 hours. This makes it ideal for correcting acute hyperglycemia quickly. Regular insulin is slower, and NPH and glargine are intermediate and long-acting, respectively.

================================================================================
Question 178 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 64-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes is diagnosed with heart failure. Which of the following medications would be a poor choice for controlling her diabetes?

Options:
  Exenatide
  Glyburide
  Nateglinide
✓ Pioglitazone
  Sitagliptin

Explanation:
Pioglitazone belongs to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of drugs. A well-known side effect of TZDs is fluid retention, which can cause or exacerbate heart failure. Therefore, these drugs carry a black box warning and are generally contraindicated in patients with symptomatic heart failure.

================================================================================
Question 179 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including tremors, anxiety, and palpitations. He has a history of untreated Graves' disease. The physician decides to initiate treatment with an antithyroid drug methimazole. Which of the following is the primary mechanism of action of this antithyroid drug?

Options:
  Inhibition of thyroid hormone release
✓ Inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis
  Destruction of thyroid tissue
  Stimulation of thyroid hormone receptors
  Inhibition of iodine absorption in the gut

Explanation:
Methimazole and other thionamide drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO). This enzyme is crucial for the organification of iodine and the coupling of iodotyrosines, which are key steps in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. By blocking this synthesis, methimazole reduces the production of new thyroid hormones.

================================================================================
Question 180 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old man with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease is considered for treatment with radioactive iodine (I-131). Which of the following statements about this treatment is true?

Options:
  Radioactive iodine is a first-line treatment for all patients with hyperthyroidism.
  Radioactive iodine treatment typically results in immediate resolution of symptoms.
✓ Patients receiving radioactive iodine should avoid close contact with others for a short period post-treatment.
  Radioactive iodine is contraindicated in patients with thyroid cancer.
  Radioactive iodine treatment does not affect thyroid hormone levels.

Explanation:
Radioactive iodine (I-131) emits radiation. After treatment, the patient's body (especially through saliva, urine, and sweat) will be radioactive for a period of time. To minimize radiation exposure to others, patients are instructed to follow safety precautions, such as avoiding close or prolonged contact with other people, especially pregnant women and young children, for several days.

================================================================================
Question 181 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32-year-old woman who has been using a copper intrauterine device (IUD) as her chosen method of traception for the past five years. She has had no issues with her IUD during this time, and it has been an ective means of preventing pregnancy for her. How does the copper IUD primarily prevent pregnancy?

Options:
  By thickening cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to enter the uterus
  By suppressing ovulation and preventing the release of eggs
  By releasing hormones that inhibit sperm motility and fertilization.
✓ By creating an unfavorable environment for sperm, impairing their ability to fertilize an egg.
  None of the above

Explanation:
The copper IUD is a non-hormonal contraceptive. It works primarily by releasing copper ions into the uterus, which creates a local inflammatory reaction that is toxic to both sperm and eggs. This sterile inflammatory environment impairs sperm motility and viability, preventing fertilization from occurring.

================================================================================
Question 182 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old male with BPH and an enlarged prostate continues to have urinary symptoms after an quate trial of tamsulosin. Dutasteride is added to his therapy. In addition to tamsulosin, he is also taking ochlorothiazide, testosterone, and vardenafil as needed prior to intercourse. Which of his medications l have an interaction with dutasteride?

Options:
  Hydrochlorothiazide
  Tamsulosin
✓ Testosterone
  Vardenafil
  None of the above

Explanation:
Dutasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. It works by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the primary androgen responsible for prostate growth. If the patient is taking exogenous testosterone, dutasteride will still block its conversion to DHT, but the high levels of testosterone itself could counteract the intended effect of shrinking the prostate. The two drugs have opposing physiological effects on the prostate.

================================================================================
Question 183 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old female presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The physician decides to ribe a first-line antibiotic known for its efficacy against E. coli and its ability to achieve high urinary ntrations. Which drug is the physician most likely to prescribe?

Options:
  Ciprofloxacin
✓ Nitrofurantoin
  Amoxicillin
  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
  Ceftriaxone

Explanation:
Nitrofurantoin is a preferred first-line antibiotic for uncomplicated cystitis (lower UTI). It is effective against the most common uropathogen, E. coli, has a low rate of resistance in many regions, and concentrates well in the urine while having minimal systemic effects, making it an ideal choice.

================================================================================
Question 184 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following statements are true regarding renal Calculi?

Options:
  Maybe the result of Gout.
  Occur as a complication of hyperparathyroidism.
  Are more apt to form in alkaline urine.
  Most frequently contain calcium, oxalate and phosphate.
✓ All of the above

Explanation:
All the statements are true. Gout causes high uric acid, leading to uric acid stones (a). Hyperparathyroidism causes high calcium levels, leading to calcium stones (b). Struvite (infection) stones form in alkaline urine (c). The most common types of stones are composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate (d).

================================================================================
Question 185 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Each of the following is A feature of ureteral Calculi except .

Options:
  It will often alodge at ureteropelvic junction,pelvic brim and vesicoureteric junction.
✓ Originate in ureteral lumen secondary to chronic ureteritis
  Cause flank pain radiating to groin.
  May cause hydronephrosis.
  May cause haematuria.

Explanation:
Renal calculi (stones) almost always originate within the kidney's collecting system. They then pass into the ureter, where they can become lodged and cause symptoms. They do not typically originate within the ureter itself.

================================================================================
Question 186 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
What percentage of renal calculi can visible on KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) radiograph?

Options:
  10%
  20%
  70%
✓ 90%
  None of the above

Explanation:
Approximately 90% of urinary calculi are radiopaque, meaning they can be seen on a standard X-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB). This is because the most common stones (calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate) contain calcium, which is dense and shows up on X-rays. Pure uric acid stones are typically radiolucent and are not visible.

================================================================================
Question 187 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Up to what size the urinary calculus can pass through the system without obstruction ?

Options:
  2mm
  4mm
✓ 5mm
  10mm
  None

Explanation:
While there is some individual variation, stones that are 5 mm or less in diameter have a high probability (around 80-90%) of passing spontaneously with conservative management (hydration and pain control). Stones larger than 5 mm are much less likely to pass on their own and often require intervention.

================================================================================
Question 188 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
HPV vaccination is aimed at girls of which age group to prevent cervical cancer?

Options:
  6-8 years
✓ 9 -11 years
  12 – 13 years
  14 – 16 years
  17 – 19 years

Explanation:
The HPV vaccine is most effective when given before the onset of sexual activity and exposure to the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Therefore, health organizations like the CDC and WHO recommend routine vaccination for both girls and boys at ages 9 to 12 years to ensure the best possible immune response and protection.

================================================================================
Question 189 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old woman presents with postmenopausal bleeding and a friable mass on her cervix that bleeds on contact. What is the next most appropriate step in management?

Options:
  Start empirical hormonal therapy
  Schedule a hysterectomy
✓ Perform a pelvic examination under anaesthesia with a biopsy
  Perform an MRI scan
  Start chemotherapy immediately

Explanation:
Postmenopausal bleeding and a friable cervical mass are highly suspicious for cervical cancer. A definitive diagnosis requires a tissue sample. Therefore, the immediate and most crucial next step is to obtain a biopsy of the cervical mass for histological examination. Performing this under anesthesia allows for a thorough examination and adequate tissue sampling.

================================================================================
Question 190 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old woman with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 1) is diagnosed. What is the appropriate management approach?

Options:
  Immediate conisation
✓ Colposcopy and cytology at 6 months
  Radical hysterectomy
  Chemoradiotherapy
  Cryotherapy

Explanation:
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 1 (CIN 1) represents a mild, low-grade dysplasia that has a very high rate of spontaneous regression, especially in younger women. The standard management is conservative observation with repeat cytology (Pap smear) and/or colposcopy at 6 to 12-month intervals to monitor for persistence or progression, rather than immediate aggressive treatment.

================================================================================
Question 191 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 44 years old multiparous obese women complains of abnormal vaginal bleeding for 6 months .Pelvic ination shows normal uterus and cervix. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Pap smear is normal. Which of llowing is the most important step in the evaluation of this patient?

Options:
✓ Endometrial biopsy
  Endometrial cytology
  Transvaginal ultrasound
  Hysteroscopy
  D and C

Explanation:
In a woman over 40 with abnormal uterine bleeding, especially with risk factors for endometrial cancer like obesity, it is mandatory to rule out endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. An endometrial biopsy is the first-line and most important diagnostic step to obtain a tissue sample for histological analysis.

================================================================================
Question 192 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following factors is protective against endometrial hyperplasia?

Options:
  Obesity
✓ Oral Contraceptive Pills
  Tamoxifen
  Early Menarche or Late Menopause
  Unopposed estrogen therapy

Explanation:
Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs) contain both estrogen and progestin. The progestin component opposes the proliferative effect of estrogen on the endometrium, causing it to remain thin and stable. This regular progestin exposure is protective against the development of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.

================================================================================
Question 193 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient has diagnosed with endometrial cancer by endometrial biopsy. During her counseling regarding the disease , staging and prognosis the patient is told that most endometrial cancer are diagnosed at which of the following stages.

Options:
✓ I
  II
  III
  IV
  Recurrent

Explanation:
Endometrial cancer typically presents with an early and obvious symptom: postmenopausal or abnormal uterine bleeding. This symptom prompts women to seek medical attention early. As a result, approximately 70-80% of endometrial cancers are diagnosed at Stage I, when the cancer is still confined to the uterus, leading to a generally good prognosis.

================================================================================
Question 194 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In addition to personal history of hypertension or diabetes and family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Which of the following is a risk factor for CA endometrium?

Options:
  USE of OCPS
✓ Obesity
  history of STDs
  nulliparity
  HPV Infection

Explanation:
Obesity is a major risk factor for endometrial cancer. Adipose (fat) tissue is a site of peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. In obese women, this leads to higher circulating levels of unopposed estrogen, which stimulates the endometrium and increases the risk of hyperplasia and carcinoma. Nulliparity (d) is also a risk factor, but obesity is one of the strongest.

================================================================================
Question 195 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old women develops post-menopausal. An endometrial biopsy shows endometrial carcinoma. She undergoes TAH with pelvic lymph node sampling. The final pathology shows tumor extending from the uterus in to the cervix but no other invasion. Lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. Stage of the cancer is,

Options:
  0
  I
✓ II
  III
  IV

Explanation:
According to the FIGO staging system for endometrial cancer, Stage II is defined as a tumor that invades the cervical stroma but does not extend beyond the uterus. Since the pathology shows the tumor extending into the cervix, the correct stage is II.

================================================================================
Question 196 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 34 years G3P2 presented to outdoor with gestational amenorrhea of 4 months and PV spotting for 3 days .On examination abdomen was large for dates. Ultrasound examination showed snow storm appearance resemb: ing complete molar pregnancy. Bilateral theca luteal cysts. Her beta HCG was 20000 IU/L. The most appropriate treatment for her,

Options:
  D and C
  Cytotoxic drugs
  conservative/radio
  TAH with BSO
✓ Suction evacuation

Explanation:
The standard and preferred treatment for a molar pregnancy (hydatidiform mole) is to empty the uterus as soon as possible to prevent complications. Suction evacuation (also called suction curettage) is the method of choice because it effectively removes the molar tissue while minimizing the risk of uterine perforation and trophoblastic embolization compared to sharp curettage (D&C).

================================================================================
Question 197 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years G5P4 comes to the OPD with the molar pregnancy. You do suction evacuation and on histopathology it came out to be complete mole. Serum beta HCG is more than one lacs. Her previous pregnancy was full term. Chest x-ray shows cannon ball appearance. Chemo therapy for her?

Options:
✓ EMA/CO
  Methotrexate only
  Methotrexate with folinic acid
  Radiotherapy
  None of the above

Explanation:
This patient has developed high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) following a molar pregnancy. The 'cannon ball' appearance on chest X-ray indicates lung metastases, and a very high beta-hCG level puts her in the high-risk category. The standard chemotherapy regimen for high-risk GTN is a multi-agent combination therapy, with EMA/CO (Etoposide, Methotrexate, Actinomycin D, Cyclophosphamide, and Oncovin/Vincristine) being the most common.

================================================================================
Question 198 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Patient presents with molar pregnancy . All the workup was done and histopathology report there was no sign of malignancy.Which of the following includes further management

Options:
✓ Weekly beta HCG
  Ultrasound monitoring
  Hysterectomy
  Reassurance
  Annual beta HCG

Explanation:
After evacuation of a molar pregnancy, it is crucial to monitor for the development of persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). This is done by serially measuring serum beta-hCG levels. The standard protocol involves weekly beta-hCG tests until the levels are undetectable for three consecutive weeks, followed by monthly tests for at least six months to ensure there is no recurrence.

================================================================================
Question 199 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Evacuation done after molar pregnancy, in which cause do we start single agent chemotherapy?

Options:
  Rise in HCG
  Liver mets
  Brain mets
  Lung mets
✓ HCG Plateau

Explanation:
Chemotherapy is indicated for post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Diagnostic criteria for GTN include a plateau of hCG levels (remaining static over 3 weeks), a rise in hCG levels (over 2 weeks), or the presence of metastases. A plateau in hCG levels when they are expected to be falling is a key indicator for initiating treatment, typically with single-agent chemotherapy (like methotrexate) for low-risk disease.

================================================================================
Question 200 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a risk factor for developing a molar pregnancy?

Options:
✓ Being under 20 years old
  History of miscarriages
  Avoiding antenatal multi vitamins
  History of high blood pressure during pregnancy
  Not maintaining healthy weight during pregnancy

Explanation:
The risk of molar pregnancy is highest at the extremes of maternal age. Women who are very young (teenagers, particularly under 20) and women of advanced maternal age (over 35-40) have a significantly increased risk compared to women in their 20s and early 30s.

================================================================================
Question 201 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22- years old patient with her husband 28 years old non smoker . married for last 3 months presented to the OPD with chief complaints of unable to conceive. her menstural cycle is regular with no significant findings her management plan is ?

Options:
  MRI scan
  pelvic ultra sound
  semen analysis
✓ reassurance
  None of the above

Explanation:
Infertility is generally defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse. This couple is young, has only been trying for 3 months, and has no significant risk factors. The vast majority of healthy young couples will conceive within the first year. Therefore, the most appropriate management at this stage is reassurance and education about timed intercourse, with no need for invasive investigations.

================================================================================
Question 202 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-years-old woman presented to gynae OPD with her husband age 56year old, non-smoker, truck driver with normal semen analysis, primary subfertility for the last 10 years. She had a history of pain during menstruation and lower abdominal pain on and off. She experiences marked pain during coitus. Ultrasound sound shows left adenaxal mass with ground glass appearance. What could be the most probable cause of her infertility?

Options:
  Adenomyosis
✓ Endometriosis
  Fibroid
  Dermoid cyst
  None of the above

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of dysmenorrhea (painful periods), chronic pelvic pain, and dyspareunia (painful intercourse) are classic for endometriosis. Furthermore, an adnexal mass with a 'ground glass' appearance on ultrasound is the characteristic finding of an endometrioma (a 'chocolate cyst'), which is a cyst on the ovary filled with old blood that forms as a result of endometriosis.

================================================================================
Question 203 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The maximum external dimension of uterine cavity is:

Options:
  7 x 7.5 x 4.5 cm
✓ 7.5 x 5 x 3 cm
  7.5 x 5 x 5 cm
  8.5 x 6 x 4 cm
  7.5 x 5 x 2 cm

Explanation:
The average dimensions of a normal, nulliparous adult uterus are approximately 7.5 to 8 cm in length (fundus to cervix), 5 cm in width at the fundus, and 2.5 to 3 cm in anteroposterior thickness. Option B most closely matches these standard anatomical measurements.

================================================================================
Question 204 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20- year-old , weight 50Kg , presents with history of something coming out of vagina since 2 years. On vaginal examination she is having 3rd degree U/V prolapse. What treatment option will you give?

Options:
✓ Sacro- colpopexy / Sacro- hysteropexy
  Vaginal hysterectomy
  Manchester repair
  Colporrhaphy
  Ring pessary

Explanation:
In a very young woman (20 years old) with severe uterine prolapse who wishes to preserve her uterus for future fertility, a hysterectomy is not appropriate. A sacrocolpopexy (if the uterus is removed) or sacrohysteropexy (if the uterus is preserved) is the best surgical option. This procedure uses a mesh to suspend the apex of the vagina or the uterus to the sacrum, providing strong, durable apical support while preserving the organs. It is considered the gold standard for apical prolapse, especially in young, active patients.

================================================================================
Question 205 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The MOST common cause of permanent congenital hypothyroidism is

Options:
  Dyshormonogenesis
✓ Thyroid dysgenesis
  IODINE deficiency
  Defect of iodide transport
  Pended syndrome

Explanation:
Thyroid dysgenesis, which refers to an abnormality in the development of the thyroid gland (including agenesis, hypoplasia, or an ectopic gland), accounts for approximately 85% of cases of permanent congenital hypothyroidism and is the most common cause worldwide.

Combined oral estrogen and progesterone therapy (systemic HRT) is the most effective pharmacological treatment for preventing bone loss and reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women, especially when initiated around menopause.

================================================================================
Question 227 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
49 years old lady who is amenorrheic for the last 12 months, is complaining of increased sweating at night, hot flushes and disturb sleep patterns? She went to her GP where her laboratory tests were done in which she had raised FSH levels. Which one of the following is most appropriate for the diagnosis of menopause?

Options:
✓ Absent menstruation for 1 year at this age.
  Bloating and irritability
  Changes in sleep pattern
  History of night sweats
  Raised level of FSH

Explanation:
The most appropriate clinical criterion for diagnosing menopause is the cessation of menstruation for 12 consecutive months without any other obvious pathological or physiological cause. The raised FSH levels provide biochemical confirmation.

================================================================================
Question 228 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 years old girl has a secondary amenorrhea of 12 months. She is being diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency. Which one of the following is responsible for this condition?

Options:
  Increased estradiol level
  LH reduced and FSH increased
  Low FSH, Raised LH
✓ Raised FSH, low estradiol level
  Raised Gonadotrophins

Explanation:
Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterized by ovarian dysfunction leading to amenorrhea before age 40. Hormonally, it presents with elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and low estradiol levels, reflecting the ovaries' diminished response to gonadotropin stimulation.

================================================================================
Question 229 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old patient presents in outpatient department with a history of 2 months amenorrhea and vaginal bleeding. Her ultrasound report shows 8 weeks single viable intrauterine pregnancy.

Options:
  Oral antibiotics
  Oral misoprostol
  Oral mifepristone
  Oral tranxamic acid
✓ Supportive treatment

Explanation:
This clinical picture describes a threatened miscarriage: vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy with a viable intrauterine pregnancy and a closed cervical os. The most appropriate management is supportive treatment, including rest and close observation, as there is no intervention proven to stop a threatened miscarriage.

================================================================================
Question 230 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years old patient is presented in out-patient department with history of irregular menstrual bleeding. Her urine pregnancy test is positive and her ultrasound report shows 7 weeks intrauterine pregnancy with absent cardiac activity. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Ectopic pregnancy
  Incomplete abortion
  Inevitable abortion
✓ Missed abortion
  Threatened abortion

Explanation:
A missed abortion (or missed miscarriage) is diagnosed when an intrauterine pregnancy is identified, but fetal cardiac activity is absent, and the products of conception are retained within the uterus without spontaneous expulsion.

================================================================================
Question 231 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28 years old patient in emergency with a complaint of amenorrhea of 2 months, lower abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding. Her urine pregnancy test is positive. Her blood pressure is 80/60 mmHg, pulse is feeble and speculum examination shows open cervical os with a passage of clots and fleshy protruding through the cervical os. What is your management?

Options:
  Bed rest and reassurance
✓ Immediate evacuation and curettage
  Intravenous antibiotics
  Intravenous tranxamic acid
  Oral misoprostol

Explanation:
This patient is presenting with signs of an inevitable or incomplete abortion (amenorrhea, abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, positive UPT, open cervical os with tissue) and is hemodynamically unstable (BP 80/60, feeble pulse). Immediate evacuation and curettage is the priority to stop the bleeding and stabilize her condition.

================================================================================
Question 232 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 years old nulliparous patient presents in outpatient department with a history of complete miscarriages at 8 weeks gestation. What is the most common aetiological factors for first trimester miscarriage?

Options:
✓ Chromosomal abnormalities
  Drugs/ Chemical
  Medical disorder
  Perinatal infections
  Uterine abnormalities

Explanation:
Chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., aneuploidy) are by far the most common etiological factor for first-trimester miscarriages, accounting for 50-70% of all pregnancy losses during this period.

================================================================================
Question 233 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26 years old patient with vaginal bleeding and positive pregnancy test. Her ultrasound report shows a 8 weeks intrauterine pregnancy. What would it be reasonable to offer her, choose single best answer?

Options:
  Laparoscopy
  Methotrexate
  Misoprostol
  Progesterone
✓ Serum HCG measurements

Explanation:
For a patient with vaginal bleeding and a confirmed 8-week intrauterine pregnancy, monitoring serial serum hCG measurements can help assess pregnancy viability and rule out complications like ectopic pregnancy, especially if there's any ambiguity in the ultrasound findings or a concern for threatened abortion. Progesterone may be offered in some cases but requires clinical judgment.

================================================================================
Question 234 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 year old woman with a history of obesity and hypertension visits her gynaecologist for a routine check up. She reports having irregular vaginal bleeding for the past two months. She is not taking any medications and his no family history of cancer. The gynaecologist suspects that she may have endometrial cancer and order a biopsy of her endometrium. What type of endometrial cancer is most likely in this case?

Options:
  Adenoacanthoma
  Adenoacanthoma with squamous differentiation
  Clear cell carcinoma
✓ Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
  Uterine serous carcinoma

Explanation:
Given the patient's age, obesity, hypertension, and presentation with irregular vaginal bleeding, the most likely type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid adenocarcinoma (Type I). This type is estrogen-dependent and is commonly associated with hyperestrogenic states and metabolic risk factors.

================================================================================
Question 235 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old woman presents to her gynaecologist with postmenopausal bleeding. She has no history of hormone replacement therapy. What is the most common clinical feature of endometrial carcinoma?

Options:
  Abdominal pain
  Dyspareunia
✓ Postmenopausal bleeding
  Urinary incontinence
  Vaginal discharge

Explanation:
Postmenopausal bleeding is the most common and often the earliest clinical symptom of endometrial carcinoma. Any bleeding after menopause warrants prompt investigation to rule out this malignancy.

================================================================================
Question 236 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 52 year old woman with a history of obesity and diabetes is diagnosed with stage I endometrioid adenocarcinoma after experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding. She undergoes a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy. The pathology report shows a grade 1 Tumor with no myometrial invasion. No cervical or ovarian involvement is seen. What is the most appropriate adjuvant therapy for her case?

Options:
  Chemotherapy
  Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy
  External beam pelvic radiotherapy
✓ No adjuvant therapy is required
  Vaginal brachytherapy

Explanation:
For Stage I, Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with no myometrial invasion and no involvement of cervix or ovaries (indicating a very low-risk tumor confined to the endometrium), often no adjuvant therapy is required after total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

================================================================================
Question 237 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old woman with a history of breast cancer is prescribed tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), as part of her adjuvant therapy. She is aware that tamoxifen can reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence, but also increase the risk of endometrial cancer. She asks her oncologist what she can do to prevent endometrial cancer while taking tamoxifen. What is the best advice that the oncologist can give her?

Options:
  Avoid consuming alcohol
✓ Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly
  Stop taking tamoxifen & switch to another medication
  Should take a low dose aspirin daily
  Undergo regular endometrial biopsies to detect

Explanation:
Maintaining a healthy weight and engaging in regular exercise are crucial lifestyle modifications that can help reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, even in women taking tamoxifen, by mitigating other risk factors like obesity-related estrogen production. Regular endometrial biopsies are for screening/detection, not prevention.

================================================================================
Question 238 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old unmarried girl presented with marked anemia and haemoglobin of 5 gm/dl. She gave history of heavy irregular cycle since menarche, her Blood clotting profile is normal with normal platelet count. The most probable diagnosis is?

Options:
  Chronic anemia
  Hemophilia
✓ Pubertal menorrhagia
  Vwb factor deficiency
  Worm infection

Explanation:
Heavy irregular cycles (menorrhagia) since menarche, especially leading to severe anemia, in an adolescent with normal clotting factors, strongly suggests pubertal menorrhagia, which is often due to anovulatory cycles and unopposed estrogen leading to excessive endometrial proliferation and bleeding. Von Willebrand factor deficiency would affect clotting profile.

================================================================================
Question 239 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old women presented with heavy irregular menses she has experienced spontaneous miscarriages over past 5 years, her pelvic examination demonstrates an enlarged irregular uterus. Her haemoglobin is 8gm/dl. Her urine pregnancy test is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Adenaxal torsion
  Ovarian teratoma
  Endometriosis
  Pregnancy
✓ Fibroid uterus

Explanation:
The symptoms of heavy, irregular menses, spontaneous miscarriages (due to uterine distortion), an enlarged, irregular uterus on examination, and anemia are highly characteristic of uterine fibroids.

================================================================================
Question 240 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old obese unmarried girl presented with amenorrhea for two months, she give history of infrequent menses with scanty flow. She developed facial hairs and temporal baldness. On ultrasound her uterus is normal with enlarged polycystic ovaries. What the diagnosis?

Options:
  Cushing syndrome
  Ovarian cysts
✓ Polycystic ovarian syndrome
  Pregnancy
  Miscarriage

Explanation:
The clinical picture of amenorrhea, infrequent menses with scanty flow (oligomenorrhea), hirsutism (facial hairs, temporal baldness), obesity, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound are classic diagnostic features of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS).

================================================================================
Question 241 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Options:
  Tab primolut N
  Tab Panadol
✓ Reassure and cap transamin
  No treatment
  Admit patient give iv antibiotics

Explanation:
Continuous per vaginal spotting is a common side effect of progesterone-only injectable contraceptives (like DMPA). The initial management usually involves reassurance, counseling about this common side effect, and potentially prescribing tranexamic acid (cap transamin) to reduce the bleeding if it's bothersome.

================================================================================
Question 242 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 46 years old patient para 5 presented with irregular bleeding her family is completed and she wants cure for her disease. She had history of blood transfusion twice. She had multiple fibroids on ultrasound. Wants the treatment?

Options:
  No treatment
  Myomectomy
✓ Hysterectomy
  Dnc
  Cap transamin

Explanation:
Given her age (46), completed family, severe symptoms (irregular bleeding requiring transfusions), and presence of multiple fibroids, hysterectomy is often the definitive and curative treatment of choice for symptomatic uterine fibroids in women who do not desire future fertility.

================================================================================
Question 243 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Fibroid uterus is a:

Options:
✓ Benign tumor of smooth muscle of uterus
  Malignant tumor of smooth muscle of uterus
  Benign tumor of ovaries
  Malignant tumor of ovaries
  None of the above

Explanation:
Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomas or myomas, are benign (non-cancerous) tumors that arise from the smooth muscle cells of the uterus.

================================================================================
Question 244 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The most common benign gynecological of women's of reproductive age is:

Options:
  Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia

================================================================================

Question:
Fibroids uterus are usually:

Options:
✓ Asymptomatic
  Symptomatic
  Lethal
  Aggressive in nature
  None of the above

Explanation:
Many uterine fibroids are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally during routine pelvic exams or imaging. However, when symptomatic, they can cause significant issues like heavy bleeding and pain.

================================================================================
Question 246 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Growth of fibroid is dependent on:

Options:
  Estrogen
  Progesterone
  Cortisol
✓ Estrogen and progesterone
  None of the above

Explanation:
The growth of uterine fibroids is primarily influenced by both estrogen and progesterone, with both hormones playing crucial roles in their development and proliferation.

================================================================================
Question 247 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is diagnostic test used for fibroids?

Options:
✓ Ultrasound PELVIS
  MRI
  X-ray
  CT SCAN
  None of the above

Explanation:
Pelvic ultrasound is the primary and most commonly used diagnostic test for identifying and characterizing uterine fibroids due to its accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to visualize the uterus. MRI is also highly effective but usually reserved for more complex cases.

================================================================================
Question 248 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28 years old women trying to conceive for the last 8 years is having a history of irregular cycles. Now has presented to you with some vaginal spotting and severe pain in the right lower quadrant of abdomen. On her initial ultrasound scan in ER there is empty uterus with some collection in pouch of Douglas is reported. The most likely diagnosis in her case is.

Options:
  Ruptured appendix
  Acute cholecystitis
✓ Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
  Mesenteric lymphadenitis
  Cecal perforation

Explanation:
The combination of amenorrhea (implied by trying to conceive for 8 years and potential recent conception leading to spotting), severe unilateral lower abdominal pain, an empty uterus on ultrasound, and free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas (indicating internal bleeding) is highly indicative of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

================================================================================
Question 249 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26 year old P1 who had a vaginal delivery 14 months back has been brought to emergency department with history of sudden fainting in kitchen. She is looking pale on examination with pulse rate of 120 beats per minutes, BP 80/60 mmHg. Per abdomen examination there is fullness in lower abdomen. On vaginal examination, cervical movements are very tender. The most appropriate management option for her would be.

Options:
  Conservative management with blood transfusion
✓ Preparation for urgent laparotomy
  Dilatation and curettage
  I/V Antibiotics
  Diagnostic laparoscopy

Explanation:
This patient is hemodynamically unstable (fainting, pale, tachycardia, hypotension) with signs of intra-abdominal bleeding (fullness, cervical motion tenderness). This clinical picture, even 14 months postpartum, suggests an acute gynecological emergency like a ruptured ovarian cyst or a delayed ruptured ectopic pregnancy (though less likely at this interval, but points to acute hemorrhage). Urgent laparotomy is indicated for diagnosis and control of hemorrhage.

================================================================================
Question 250 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 34 year old woman who was under investigation for primary infertility presented with history of amenorrhea for 14 days and urine pregnancy test is positive. Her ultrasound scan reports empty uterine cavity but presence of right sided adnexal mass about 4x4 cm with increased vascularity. There is no free fluid in pouch of Douglas. The most appropriate treatment option in her would be.

Options:
✓ I/M methotrexate with serial hCG
  Posterior colpotomy
  Diagnostic laparoscopy
  Exploratory laparotomy
  Serum progesterone levels

Explanation:
This scenario strongly points to an unruptured ectopic pregnancy (positive UPT, empty uterus, adnexal mass with vascularity, no free fluid). Given her stability and the size, medical management with intramuscular methotrexate and serial hCG monitoring is often the first-line treatment for suitable cases of unruptured ectopic pregnancy.

================================================================================
Question 251 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 36 year old patient has received an IM Methotrexate injection as medical line of management for her right sided ectopic pregnancy 8 days ago. She has now come for follow up with fresh hCG level reports. What levels of beta-hCG would be considered as satisfactory response of IM Methotrexate?

Options:
  Half the initial level
  2/3rd the initial level
✓ 25% or more below initial level
  5% or below the initial level
  Rise of 10% at this stage of insignificant

Explanation:
After methotrexate treatment for ectopic pregnancy, a satisfactory response is typically defined as a decrease in serum beta-hCG of at least 15% between Day 4 and Day 7, or a decrease of 25% or more from the baseline level by Day 7 post-treatment. Among the given options, '25% or more below initial level' represents a generally accepted decrease.

================================================================================
Question 252 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22-year-old woman has been sexually assaulted. She requests a postcoital contraceptive. Which of the following usually Is the most appropriate drug, assuming no contraindications?

Options:
  Ergonovine (or methylergonovine)
✓ Mifepristone
  Raloxifene
  Ritodrine
  Tamoxifen

Explanation:
Mifepristone (an antiprogestin) is an effective emergency contraceptive, often used in cases of sexual assault. It can be used up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. Levonorgestrel (Plan B) is also a common option.

================================================================================
Question 253 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
We prescribe bromocriptine for a woman with primary amenorrhea. Normal menstruation returns about a month after starting therapy. Which of the following statements best described the mechanism by which bromocriptine caused its desired effects?

Options:
  Blocked estrogen receptors, enhanced gonadotropin release
  Increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis
✓ Inhibited prolactin release
  Stimulated ovarian estrogen and progestin synthesis
  Stimulated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release

Explanation:
Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that inhibits prolactin release from the pituitary gland. Hyperprolactinemia is a common cause of primary or secondary amenorrhea by suppressing GnRH release, thus inhibiting ovulation. By lowering prolactin, bromocriptine restores normal ovulatory function and menstruation.

================================================================================
Question 254 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with a previously undiagnosed thyroid cancer presents with thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm). One drug that is administered as part of early management, and may be lifesaving, is propranolol. Which of the following best summarizes why we give this drug, or what we want it to do?

Options:
  Block thyroid receptors
  Block thyroid hormone release by a direct effect on the gland
  Inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis
✓ Lessen dangerous cardiovascular symptoms of hyperthyroidism
  Lower TSH levels

Explanation:
Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is given in thyroid storm to rapidly control the severe cardiovascular symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia, palpitations, and tremor, which are mediated by sympathetic overactivity. It also has a minor effect on inhibiting peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.

================================================================================
Question 255 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with Cushing's syndrome is being treated by X-irradiation of the pituitary. It may take several months of treatment for adequate symptomatic and metabolic improvement. Until that time, which of the following might be administered adjunctively to suppress glucocorticoid synthesis?

Options:
  Cimetidine
  Cortisol (massive doses)
  Fludrocortisone
✓ Ketoconazole
  Spironolactone

Explanation:
Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that, at higher doses, inhibits several cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in adrenal steroid synthesis, including cortisol synthesis. It can be used adjunctively to suppress glucocorticoid production in Cushing's syndrome while awaiting the effects of pituitary irradiation.

================================================================================

Options:
✓ Agranulocytosis
  Cholestatic jaundice
  Gout
  Renal tubular necrosis
  Rhabdomyolysis

Explanation:
Agranulocytosis (a severe decrease in white blood cells) is a rare but life-threatening adverse effect of propylthiouracil (PTU) and other thionamides, requiring close monitoring and immediate discontinuation if suspected. Severe liver injury is also a serious concern with PTU.

================================================================================
Question 257 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old woman at very high risk of breast cancer is given Tamoxifen for prophylaxis. Tamoxifen does which of the following in this situation?

Options:
✓ Blocks estrogen receptors in breast tissue
  Blocks estrogen receptors in the endometrium
  Increases the risk of osteoporosis
  Raises serum LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol, lowers HDL
  Reduces the risk of thromboembolic disorders

Explanation:
Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in breast tissue, thereby blocking estrogen's proliferative effects and reducing the risk of breast cancer.

================================================================================
Question 258 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Clinical study was performed on patients having Glomerulonephritis. One group was diagnosis with Crescentic glomerulonephritis and another group with Membranous glomerulonephritis. Which one of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be found in group with Membranous glomerulonephritis in the absence of other findings?

Options:
  Rapid onset
  Red blood cell casts
  Oliguria
✓ Albuminuria
  Hypertension

Explanation:
Membranous glomerulonephritis is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and its hallmark laboratory finding is significant proteinuria, primarily albuminuria, which often leads to hypoalbuminemia and edema. Rapid onset, red blood cell casts, oliguria, and hypertension are more characteristic of nephritic syndromes.

================================================================================
Question 259 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Hematuria is least likely to occur in:

Options:
✓ Minimal change disease
  Acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis
  Urinary lithiasis
  Renal tubular adenocarcinoma
  Membrano-glomerulo nephritis

Explanation:
Minimal change disease is characterized by selective proteinuria (leading to nephrotic syndrome) and is notable for the absence of significant hematuria, unlike most other glomerulonephritides or conditions causing urinary bleeding.

================================================================================
Question 260 (KGMC - 2023)

Options:
  Spike and doom appearance
✓ Humps
  Deposition of IgM and C3
  Ribbon like basement membrane
  Splitting of basement membrane

Explanation:
The clinical picture describes acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). The key morphological feature seen on electron microscopy of a kidney biopsy in APSGN is the presence of discrete, subepithelial electron-dense immune deposits, often referred to as 'humps'.

================================================================================
Question 265 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient presents with hematuria, proteinuria on urinalysis, edema and recurrent episodes of gross hematuria.

Question 266 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a patient with a Tubulointerstitial nephritis, which of the following is true?

Options:
  The patient always has symptoms.
  Renal tubular acidosis may not be present.
  In chronic disease a rash is always present.
  Interstitial nephritis never impairs renal function.
✓ In acute disease there may also be a high blood eosinophil count (eosinophilia) and eosinophils in the urine (eosinophiluria)

Explanation:
In acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN), particularly drug-induced forms, a systemic hypersensitivity reaction is common. This can manifest as a peripheral eosinophilia (high blood eosinophil count) and the presence of eosinophils in the urine (eosinophiluria).

================================================================================
Question 267 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following statements is more relevant to renal tract stone formation?

Options:
  A low urine oxalate level.
✓ Repeated urinary tract infection and stasis.
  A low urine calcium level.
  A low urine Urate levels.
  High protein diet.

Explanation:
Repeated urinary tract infections (especially with urease-producing bacteria) and urinary stasis (impaired urine flow) are significant risk factors for the formation of certain types of renal stones, particularly struvite stones, by creating conditions favorable for crystal precipitation.

================================================================================
Question 268 (KGMC - 2023)

Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to elevated levels of calcium (hypercalcemia) in the blood. The morphologic changes in other organs are due to this elevated calcium.

================================================================================
Question 272 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 31-year-old woman, who has two healthy children, notes that she has had no menstrual periods for the past 6 months, but she is not pregnant and takes no medications. Within the past week, she has noted some milk production from her breasts. She has been bothered by headaches for the past 3 months. An optometrist finds her lateral vision to be reduced. On physical examination she is afebrile and normotensive. Which of the following laboratory test findings is most likely to be present in this woman?

Options:
  Increased serum cortisol
  Lack of growth hormone suppression
  Increased serum alkaline phosphatase
✓ Hyperprolactinemia
  Decreased serum TSH

Explanation:
The combination of amenorrhea, galactorrhea (milk production), headaches, and visual field defects (reduced lateral vision, suggestive of bitemporal hemianopsia) is highly indicative of a prolactinoma (a pituitary tumor secreting prolactin). This would result in hyperprolactinemia.

================================================================================
Question 273 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2-year-old child has failure to thrive since infancy. Physical examination shows that the child is short and has coarse facial features, a protruding tongue, and an umbilical hernia. As the child matures, profound intellectual disability becomes apparent. A deficiency of which of the following hormones is most likely to explain these findings?

Options:
  Cortisol
  Insulin
  Norepinephrine
  Somatostatin
✓ Thyroxin (T4)

Explanation:
The clinical features of failure to thrive, short stature, coarse facial features, a protruding tongue, an umbilical hernia, and profound intellectual disability are characteristic of congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism), which is caused by a deficiency of thyroxine (T4).

================================================================================

A 50-year-old man with fasting blood glucose >140 mg/dL on two occasions is put on a restricted caloric diet and started on an oral hypoglycemic agent. Which of the following laboratory studies is most likely to afford the best method of monitoring disease control in this man?

Options:
  Cholesterol, total
  Fasting plasma glucose
✓ Glycosylated hemoglobin
  Microalbuminuria
  Random plasma glucose

Explanation:
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) provides an average measure of blood glucose control over the preceding 2-3 months. It is the best method for long-term monitoring of disease control in diabetic patients.

================================================================================
Question 275 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42-year-old woman presents with amenorrhea and emotional disturbances. You note upper truncal obesity and suspect Cushing syndrome. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum levels of corticosteroids that can be lowered by administration of dexamethasone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of hypercortisolism in this patient?

Options:
  Adrenal cortical adenoma
  Adrenal cortical carcinoma
  Adrenal cortical hyperplasia
  Pheochromocytoma
✓ Pituitary adenoma (Corticotroph cells producing adenoma)

Explanation:
Cushing's syndrome characterized by elevated corticosteroids that are suppressible by dexamethasone is indicative of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. The most common cause of this is Cushing's disease, which is due to a pituitary adenoma secreting ACTH (corticotroph cell adenoma).

================================================================================
Question 276 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one is the most significant factor that leads to the metabolic derangements seen in type II diabetes mellitus?

Options:
  Lack of B cells in islets of Langerhans
  Chronic renal failure
✓ Peripheral insulin resistance
  Overproduction of amylin protein
  Development of autoantibodies to insulin

Explanation:
Peripheral insulin resistance is the hallmark and most significant underlying factor leading to the metabolic derangements observed in Type 2 diabetes mellitus. It results in reduced glucose uptake by tissues despite adequate insulin levels, leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia and eventually beta-cell exhaustion.

================================================================================
Question 277 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28-year-old woman has had difficulty concentrating at work for the past month. She is constantly getting up and walking around to visit co-workers. She complains that the work area is too hot. She seems nervous and often spills her tea. She has been eating more but has lost 5 kg in the past 2 months. On physical examination her temperature is 37.5 C, pulse 101/minute, respiratory rate 22/minute, and blood pressure 145/85 mm Hg. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be present in this woman?

Options:
  Decreased catechol amines
  Decreased iodine uptake
  Decreased plasma Insulin
✓ Decreased TSH
  Increased ACTH

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (difficulty concentrating, restlessness, heat intolerance, nervousness, weight loss despite increased appetite, tachycardia, hypertension) are classic for hyperthyroidism. In primary hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland overproduces hormones, which then suppresses the release of TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) from the pituitary, leading to a decreased TSH level.

================================================================================
Question 278 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 29-year-old primigravida who received no prenatal care has marked vaginal bleeding after the onset of labor at 38 weeks gestation. Cesarean section is performed and a lacerated low-lying placenta is removed. She remains hypotensive for 6 hours and requires transfusion of 12 packed RBC units. Postpartum, she becomes unable to breastfeed the infant. She does not have a resumption of normal menstrual cycles. She becomes more sluggish and tired. Which of the following pathologic lesions is she most likely to have had following delivery?

Options:
  Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage
✓ Pituitary necrosis
  Subacute thyroiditis
  Metastatic choriocarcinoma
  Insulitis

Explanation:
The history of severe postpartum hemorrhage leading to prolonged hypotension, followed by inability to lactate (due to prolactin deficiency), amenorrhea (due to gonadotropin deficiency), and symptoms of sluggishness and fatigue (due to TSH and/or ACTH deficiency), is classic for Sheehan's syndrome (postpartum pituitary necrosis).

================================================================================
Question 279 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 49-year-old woman has had increasing cold Intolerance, weight gain of 4 kg, and sluggishness over the past two years. A physical examination reveals dry, coarse skin and alopecia of the scalp.

Which of the following thyroid diseases is she most likely to have?

Options:
  DeQuervain disease
  Papillary carcinoma
✓ Hashimoto thyroiditis
  

Explanation:
The clinical symptoms of cold intolerance, weight gain, sluggishness, dry/coarse skin, alopecia, along with laboratory findings of raised TSH and low thyroxine (hypothyroidism), and the presence of high titers of antithyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies, are all characteristic features of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis), the most common autoimmune cause of hypothyroidism.

================================================================================
Question 280 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old man has episodic headaches for 3 months. On physical examination his blood pressure is 185/110 mm Hg, with no other remarkable findings. Laboratory studies show a normal sodium, potassium, and chloride levels, glucose 91 mg/dl. An abdominal CT scan shows a 7 cm left adrenal mass. During surgery, as the left adrenal gland is removed, there is a marked rise in blood pressure. Which of the following laboratory test findings most likely explains his findings?

Options:
  Decreased serum cortisol
  Decreased urinary homovanillic acid
  Increased serum ACTH
✓ Increased urinary free catechol amines
  Increased insulin levels

Explanation:
The episodic headaches, hypertension, adrenal mass, and the marked rise in blood pressure during adrenal gland manipulation are classic signs of a pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal medulla). This tumor secretes excessive catecholamines, which would be reflected by increased urinary free catecholamines and their metabolites (e.g., metanephrines).

================================================================================
Question 281 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 33-year-old previously healthy man has lateral visual field deficits, but his residual vision is 20/20. His facial features have changed over the past year. His shoe size has increased.

Options:
  Antidiuretic hormone
  Prolactin
  ACTH
✓ Growth hormone
  Luteinizing hormone

Explanation:
The symptoms of lateral visual field deficits (suggesting optic chiasm compression), changes in facial features, increased shoe size (acral growth), and enlargement of the sella turcica are classic signs of acromegaly, which is caused by excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH) from a pituitary adenoma.

investigation of choice for a young lady presenting with burning micturation for the first time

Options:
  u/s abd
  x ray kub
✓ urine R E
  serum creatinine
  intravenous pyelography

Explanation:
For a young lady presenting with burning micturition (dysuria), the investigation of first choice is a urine routine examination (urine R/E) and culture to diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is the most common cause of these symptoms.

================================================================================
Question 314 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the investigation of choice for a 10-year-old boy presented with peri-orbital and generalized body swelling and pitting edema feet with normal X-ray chest and ECG?

Options:
  Ultrasound kidneys
✓ 24-hour urinary protein
  Electrocardiography
  Serum creatinine
  Thyroid function tests

Explanation:
The clinical picture of peri-orbital and generalized body swelling with pitting edema in a child, without evidence of cardiac or pulmonary issues (normal CXR, ECG), is highly suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. The investigation of choice to confirm nephrotic syndrome is a 24-hour urinary protein collection, which will quantify the degree of proteinuria (typically >3.5 g/24 hours).

================================================================================
Question 315 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
all of the following are features of nephrotic syndrome except

Options:
  Proteinuria
  Hypoalbuminemia
  Hypertriglyceridemia
  Generalized edema
✓ Haematuria

Explanation:
Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, generalized edema, and hyperlipidemia (including hypertriglyceridemia). While microscopic hematuria can occasionally occur, gross hematuria is not a characteristic feature; it's more indicative of nephritic syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 316 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children?

Options:
  Diabetes Mellitus
  Henoch-Schonlein purpura
  IgA nephropathy
✓ Minimal change disease
  Membranous nephropathy

Explanation:
Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, accounting for approximately 80-90% of cases. It is characterized by selective proteinuria and typically responds well to corticosteroids.

================================================================================
Question 317 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old female with feeling of swelling in body severe constipation and hoarseness of voice for last 4 month she look pale with puffy face. best investigation is

Options:
✓ TSH
  T3T4
  SERUM PROLACTIN.
  FSH LH.
  Renal functional test

Explanation:
The symptoms of body swelling, severe constipation, hoarseness of voice, pale and puffy face (myxedema) are highly suggestive of hypothyroidism. Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is the most sensitive first-line test for diagnosing primary hypothyroidism.

================================================================================
Question 318 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
hematuria of glomerular origin is highly suggested by which of the following urine analysis

Options:
  White cell cast
  Muddy cast
  Stoney cast
✓ Red cell cast
  Fatty cast

Explanation:
The presence of red cell casts in the urine sediment is a strong indicator of hematuria of glomerular origin (i.e., bleeding from the glomeruli), as red blood cells become entrapped in the protein matrix within the renal tubules.

================================================================================
Question 319 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
1.5 years old boy is brought to ur clinic with testicular mass by his parents on evaluation he has raised AFP but no metastasis identified by imaging of the abdomen and chest the boy went right radical inguinal orchidectomy histology showed yolk sac tumor limited to right testis his AFP decreased back to normal on follow up which is true regarding the patient further treatment:

Options:
  No further radiological surveillance is required
✓ Adjuvant chemotherapy is not required
  One cycle of chemotherapy is indicated
  Cycles of chemotherapy is indicated
  Radiotherapy is indicated

Explanation:
Yolk sac tumors in children, when stage I (confined to the testis) and completely resected with normalization of AFP, often do not require adjuvant chemotherapy. Close surveillance with AFP monitoring is usually sufficient, as the tumor is highly sensitive to chemotherapy if recurrence occurs. Thus, adjuvant chemotherapy is not required in this scenario.

================================================================================
Question 320 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 63 year old man has got gradual painless swelling of his left testis. Physical examination shows noticeable enlargement and firm consistency of left testis. The right testis is normal. His Serum LDH, AFP and BHCG were normal. He underwent Left Orchidectomy. Which variant of testicular tumor you mostly expect?

Options:
✓ Lymphoma
  Non-Seminomatous
  Seminoma
  Teratoma
  Sertoli Cell Tumor

Explanation:
In older men (over 60), a painless testicular mass that is firm and enlarged, especially with normal tumor markers (LDH, AFP, β-hCG), should raise suspicion for testicular lymphoma. While seminomas are also common, the age and normal markers make lymphoma a strong consideration in this demographic.

================================================================================
Question 321 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Cherry tumor in the rectum of a child is called?

Options:
  Hyperplastic polyp
  Inflammatory polyp
✓ Juvenile polyp
  Pseudopolyp
  Pedunculate polyp

Explanation:
A 'cherry tumor' in the rectum of a child typically refers to a juvenile polyp, which is a benign hamartomatous polyp commonly found in the rectum and colon of children. They are often pedunculated and can present with painless rectal bleeding.

================================================================================
Question 322 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which test is of least value in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia?

Options:
  CT ABDOMEN
✓ IVU (intravenous urography)
  Transrectal ultrasound
  Ultrasound Abdomen & Pelvis
  X ray KUB

Explanation:
Intravenous Urography (IVU) is a relatively invasive test that uses radiation and contrast dye, and its role in the routine evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has largely been replaced by less invasive and more informative imaging modalities like ultrasound. CT abdomen may be used to rule out other pathology, but is not primarily for BPH itself, similar to X-ray KUB. Transrectal ultrasound directly visualizes the prostate.

================================================================================
Question 323 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A Woman 50 year old having everted umblicous abdominal distension thril echogenic liver huge ascites albumin and urea 8 4 creatine :1-2 cause of ascites

Options:
  Chronic kidney
✓ Liver disease
  Tuberculous abdomen
  Hypogonadism

Explanation:
The clinical findings of everted umbilicus, abdominal distension, thrill (likely referring to caput medusae or fluid wave), echogenic liver, and huge ascites are all highly suggestive of advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) leading to portal hypertension and fluid retention. The albumin and urea values (if 8 and 4 respectively) are problematic and likely typos, but the overall clinical picture strongly points to liver pathology as the cause of ascites.

================================================================================
Question 324 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old man presented with headache, muscle weakness, and fatigue. BP 170/100 mmHg. Serum Na = 149, Serum K = 2.7, Plasma renin = suppressed, Plasma aldosterone = elevated. Diagnosis:

Options:
  Cushing syndrome
✓ Conn’s syndrome
  Secondary hyperaldosteronism
  Pheochromocytoma
  SIADH

Explanation:
Conn's syndrome (Primary Hyperaldosteronism) is characterized by the autonomous secretion of aldosterone. This leads to sodium retention (hypernatremia), potassium excretion (hypokalemia), and hypertension. Crucially, the high aldosterone levels suppress renin production through negative feedback, distinguishing it from secondary hyperaldosteronism where renin is high.

================================================================================
Question 325 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10-year-old girl presents with increased thirst and hunger for several weeks, copious urine, and unconsciousness for 4 hours. BG = 440 mg/dL, pH = 7.1, HCO₃ = 10 mEq/L, Urea = 35 mg/dL. Diagnosis:

Options:
  Acute renal failure
  Acute UTI
✓ Diabetic ketoacidosis
  Paracetamol poisoning
  Hypoglycemic coma

Explanation:
The clinical picture of a young child with polyuria, polydipsia, severe hyperglycemia (440 mg/dL), and metabolic acidosis (low pH, low bicarbonate) is the classic presentation of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), often the initial presentation of Type 1 Diabetes.

================================================================================
Question 326 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old woman has recurrent renal stones, bone pain, and abdominal distension. Plasma calcium = 12.2 mg/dL, PTH = elevated. Diagnosis:

Options:
✓ Primary hyperparathyroidism
  Secondary hyperparathyroidism
  Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
  Hypoparathyroidism
  Vitamin D intoxication

Explanation:
The patient presents with the classic 'stones, bones, and abdominal groans' of hypercalcemia. The combination of hypercalcemia and elevated Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) confirms Primary Hyperparathyroidism, where the parathyroid gland inappropriately secretes PTH despite high calcium levels.

================================================================================
Question 327 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 57-year-old patient presented comatosed with decreased skin turgor. Blood glucose 780 mg/dL, no ketosis, 4+ glycosuria. Diagnosis:

Options:
  Type 1 DM
✓ Type 2 DM (Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state)
  Cushing syndrome
  Glucagon-secreting tumor
  High glucose uptake

Explanation:
Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) typically occurs in Type 2 Diabetes. It is characterized by severe hyperglycemia and dehydration (hyperosmolarity) but, unlike DKA, there is a lack of significant ketosis because there is enough insulin present to prevent lipolysis but not enough to utilize glucose.

================================================================================
Question 328 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old man with small cell lung carcinoma presents with confusion and seizures. Na⁺ = 118, serum osmolality = low, urine osmolality = high. Diagnosis:

Options:
  Diabetes insipidus
✓ SIADH
  Conn’s syndrome
  Cerebral salt wasting
  Psychogenic polydipsia

Explanation:
Small cell lung carcinoma is a common cause of paraneoplastic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). Excess ADH leads to water retention, causing dilutional hyponatremia (Na 118) and low serum osmolality, while the urine remains inappropriately concentrated (high urine osmolality).

================================================================================
Question 329 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38-year-old man has enlarged jaw, hands, and feet. Serum IGF-1 elevated, not responding to feedback. What is the most common visual complication?

Options:
  Diabetes insipidus
✓ Bitemporal hemianopsia
  Visual hallucinations
  Nephrogenic DI
  SIADH

Explanation:
The symptoms describe acromegaly, which is caused by a pituitary macroadenoma. As the tumor grows upwards out of the sella turcica, it compresses the optic chiasm, leading to bitemporal hemianopsia (loss of the outer visual fields in both eyes).

================================================================================
Question 330 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48-year-old female with back pain, weakness, BP 165/110, BMI 28, plethoric face, glucose 155 mg/dL. X-ray: compression fracture at T10. Likely pathology:

Options:
✓ Adrenal cortical adenoma (Cushing’s syndrome)
  Addison's disease
  Hypothyroidism
  Pheochromocytoma
  Acromegaly

Explanation:
The patient exhibits classic features of Cushing's syndrome: central obesity, facial plethora, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis (leading to compression fractures). An adrenal cortical adenoma is a common primary adrenal cause of this syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 331 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22-year-old male with severe right flank pain radiating to groin, restlessness, vomiting, and microscopic hematuria. Diagnosis:

Options:
  Acute appendicitis
✓ Renal colic due to ureteric stone
  Pyelonephritis
  Diverticulitis
  Testicular torsion

Explanation:
The clinical picture of sudden, severe, colicky flank pain radiating to the groin (loin-to-groin), accompanied by vomiting and restlessness (patient cannot find a comfortable position), is pathognomonic for ureteric colic caused by a kidney stone.

================================================================================
Question 332 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old male with flank pain, hematuria, abdominal bruising, CT shows grade 3 renal injury. Management:

Options:
  Immediate nephrectomy
✓ Conservative management with monitoring
  Angioembolization
  Surgical exploration
  Dialysis

Explanation:
Most blunt renal injuries, including Grade 3 (laceration involving the cortex/medulla but not the collecting system), are managed conservatively if the patient is hemodynamically stable. This involves bed rest, monitoring vital signs, and serial hemoglobin/hematocrit checks.

================================================================================
Question 333 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Onion-skinning of renal arterioles is a feature of:

Options:
  Diabetic nephropathy
✓ Malignant hypertension
  Amyloidosis
  Renal vein thrombosis
  Benign nephrosclerosis

Explanation:
Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis, which appears as concentric lamination of smooth muscle cells and basement membrane ('onion-skinning') in the vessel walls, is the hallmark histological finding of malignant hypertension.

================================================================================
Question 334 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules are seen in:

Options:
✓ Diabetic nephropathy
  Hypertensive nephropathy
  FSGS
  Membranous nephropathy
  Amyloidosis

Explanation:
Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions are nodular accumulations of mesangial matrix. They are a specific and pathognomonic histological finding in diabetic glomerulosclerosis (diabetic nephropathy).

================================================================================
Question 335 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Red cell casts are seen in:

Options:
✓ Glomerulonephritis / Post-streptococcal GN
  Pyelonephritis
  Nephrotic syndrome
  Acute tubular necrosis
  Cystitis

Explanation:
Red blood cell casts in the urine sediment indicate bleeding from the glomerulus (nephritic syndrome). This is a hallmark of glomerulonephritis, such as Acute Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (AGN).

================================================================================
Question 336 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Level of C3 returns to normal in Acute Glomerulonephritis (AGN) after:

Options:
  1 week
  2 weeks
  4 weeks
✓ 8 weeks
  6 months

Explanation:
In acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, serum complement levels (specifically C3) are low due to consumption. They typically return to normal within 6 to 8 weeks. Persistently low C3 beyond this period suggests a different pathology (e.g., MPGN).

================================================================================
Question 337 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Orphan Annie nuclei seen on biopsy of:

Options:
✓ Papillary thyroid carcinoma
  Follicular thyroid carcinoma
  Medullary thyroid carcinoma
  Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
  Hashimoto's thyroiditis

Explanation:
'Orphan Annie' eye nuclei (nuclei with central clearing/empty appearance) are a classic and diagnostic cytological feature of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 338 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Lipoid nephrosis (Minimal change disease) microscopy findings:

Options:
  LM: Proliferation, EM: Deposits
✓ LM: Normal glomeruli, EM: Fusion of podocyte foot processes
  LM: Thickened basement membrane, EM: Spikes
  LM: Crescents, EM: No change
  LM: Sclerosis, EM: Detachment

Explanation:
In Minimal Change Disease, the glomeruli appear normal under Light Microscopy (LM). The pathology is only visible under Electron Microscopy (EM), which reveals the effacement (fusion) of podocyte foot processes.

================================================================================
Question 339 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Hormone produced in luteal phase due to corpus luteum:

Options:
  Estrogen
✓ Progesterone
  LH
  FSH
  GnRH

Explanation:
After ovulation, the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. Progesterone is essential for maintaining the endometrial lining for potential implantation.

================================================================================

Question:
Fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina develop from:

Options:
  Mesonephric ducts
✓ Müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts
  Urogenital sinus
  Metanephros
  Wolffian ducts

Explanation:
In female embryological development, the Müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts fuse to form the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and the upper portion of the vagina.

================================================================================
Question 343 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Most common site of endometriosis:

Options:
✓ Ovary
  Fallopian tube
  Rectovaginal septum
  Peritoneum
  Cervix

Explanation:
While endometriosis can occur anywhere in the pelvic cavity, the ovaries are the most frequent location for ectopic endometrial implants (often forming endometriomas).

================================================================================
Question 344 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
40-year-old woman with irregular heavy bleeding, no desire for pregnancy. First-line management:

Options:
  Hysterectomy
  Combined Oral Contraceptives
✓ LNG-IUS (Levonorgestrel intrauterine system)
  Tranexamic acid
  Endometrial ablation

Question:
45-year-old female with rapid swelling, redness, peau d’orange breast, not lactating. Diagnosis:

Options:
  Mastitis
  Breast abscess
✓ Inflammatory breast carcinoma
  Fibrocystic change
  Duct ectasia

Explanation:
Inflammatory breast carcinoma presents with rapid onset erythema, edema, and a 'peau d'orange' (orange peel) appearance of the skin due to lymphatic obstruction. In a non-lactating woman with these signs, malignancy must be suspected over infection.

================================================================================
Question 354 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
22-year-old female with fatigue, distension, early satiety; ovarian mass, ↑ AFP and β-hCG. Diagnosis:

Options:
  Dysgerminoma
  Yolk sac tumor
✓ Mixed germ cell tumor
  Choriocarcinoma
  Granulosa cell tumor

Explanation:
AFP is a marker for Yolk Sac tumors, and β-hCG is a marker for Choriocarcinoma/Dysgerminoma. The elevation of *both* markers strongly suggests a Mixed Germ Cell Tumor containing elements of multiple cell types.

================================================================================
Question 355 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Clomiphene citrate mechanism of action:

Options:
✓ Estrogen receptor antagonist (at hypothalamus and pituitary)
  Estrogen receptor agonist
  Progesterone receptor antagonist
  GnRH agonist
  Aromatase inhibitor

Explanation:
Clomiphene is a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM). It antagonizes estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, blocking the negative feedback of estrogen. This leads to increased secretion of FSH and LH, stimulating ovulation.

================================================================================

Question:
Woman on combined oral contraceptives develops hypertension; responsible component:

Options:
✓ Ethinylestradiol
  Levonorgestrel
  Norethisterone
  Desogestrel
  Placebo

Explanation:
The estrogen component (Ethinylestradiol) in combined oral contraceptives increases the hepatic synthesis of angiotensinogen, which can lead to increased blood pressure via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

================================================================================

Options:
  Estradiol levels are high
✓ Increased sensitivity to insulin
  Chances of conception with ovulation induction are high
  Androstenedione levels are high
  Sex-hormone binding globulin are high

Explanation:
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by insulin resistance, meaning a *decreased* sensitivity to insulin, not increased. Other features often include high estradiol, elevated androstenedione, and *low* Sex-Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). Conception chances can be improved with ovulation induction.

================================================================================
Question 445 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The commonest cause of Subfertility is:

Options:
  Tubal obstruction
  Male factor
✓ Chronic anovulation

================================================================================
Question 446 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Hirsutism can be found in all of the following conditions except:

Options:
  Polycystic ovarian syndrome
  Danazol therapy
  Adrenal hyperplasia
✓ Oral contraceptive pills
  Androgen secreting ovarian tumor

Explanation:
Hirsutism, or excessive hair growth, is caused by increased androgen levels. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), Danazol therapy (an androgenic agent), adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting ovarian tumors all lead to elevated androgens. Oral contraceptive pills, especially those with anti-androgenic progestins, are often used to *treat* hirsutism, not cause it.

================================================================================

================================================================================
Question 448 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In Sheehan's syndrome, changes that take place include all of the following except:

Options:
  Complete lactation failure
  Feeling of lethargy
  Genital atrophy
  Amenorrhea
✓ Increased basal metabolic rate

Explanation:
Sheehan's syndrome is postpartum pituitary necrosis leading to hypopituitarism. Symptoms include complete lactation failure, amenorrhea, genital atrophy, and lethargy. It causes a *decreased* basal metabolic rate due to hypothyroidism secondary to TSH deficiency, not an increased rate.

================================================================================
Question 449 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old female Para 2 is presented with secondary amenorrhea of seven months. She expresses the desire to conceive again. After exclusion of pregnancy, which of the following tests is indicated next?

Options:
  Hysterosalpingogram
  Endometrial biopsy
  Thyroid function tests
  Testosterone and DHEA level

================================================================================
Question 451 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Polycystic ovarian diseases, all of the following can be seen, EXCEPT:

Options:
  Acne
  Streak ovaries
  Insulin resistance
  Hirsutism
✓ Galactorrhea

Explanation:
Acne, insulin resistance, and hirsutism are common features of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) due to hyperandrogenism and metabolic dysfunction. Streak ovaries are characteristic of Turner Syndrome, not PCOS. Galactorrhea is not a typical symptom of PCOS unless there is an associated hyperprolactinemia, which is a separate condition.

================================================================================
Question 452 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Urge incontinence:

Options:
  is due to pelvic anatomic defect.
  Patient loses small amount of urine.
  Can be diagnosed with stress test.
✓ Can be treated medically.
  Can be treated surgically with sling

Explanation:
Urge incontinence is characterized by a sudden, strong urge to urinate followed by involuntary leakage. It is primarily a bladder (detrusor) dysfunction rather than an anatomic defect and can often be effectively treated medically with anticholinergic or beta-3 agonist medications.

================================================================================
Question 453 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The most likely cause of abnormal uterine bleeding in 13yrs old girl:

Options:
  Uterine cancer
  Trauma
✓ Anovulation
  Systemic bleeding diatheses
  Pregnancy

Explanation:
In adolescent girls, abnormal uterine bleeding is most commonly caused by anovulation due to an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to irregular and often heavy bleeding.

================================================================================
Question 454 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 61 year old lady becomes Incontinent Immediately after a transvaginal repair of grade 3 cystocele. This is most likely due to:

Options:
  Detrusor instability
  Partial bladder denervation
✓ Underlying urethral deficiency
  Iatrogenic urethral damage
  Iatrogenic bladder neck injury

Explanation:
Developing new-onset incontinence immediately after cystocele repair often suggests unmasking of an underlying stress urinary incontinence or intrinsic sphincter deficiency that was previously concealed by the prolapse.

================================================================================
Question 455 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old woman develops urinary leakage of urine and is found to have a ureterovaginal fistula 5 days after TAH after complete evaluation. Attempts to pass antegrade and retrograde stent is unsuccessful. The most appropriate management is.

Options:
  Observation
  Ureteroneocystostomy
  Ureterouretrostomy
✓ Percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN)

Explanation:
In cases of a ureterovaginal fistula where conservative measures like stenting have failed, initial management often involves diverting urine flow away from the fistula to allow healing. A percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) allows for temporary urinary diversion, reducing urine leakage through the fistula and potentially facilitating surgical repair later if needed. Definitive surgical repair (ureteroneocystostomy, ureteroureterostomy) would follow after stabilization and assessment.

================================================================================
Question 456 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 year old pregnant female presents with burning micturation, frequent urination and urgency for 2 days.

================================================================================
Question 466 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 years old woman presents with recurrent episodes of postmenopausal bleeding and post coital bleeding. Her previous gynaecological history is unremarkable, with a lifetime of normal cervical smears. She is not on any drugs, including HRT. Pelvic ultrasound and endometrial biopsy are normal. Vaginal examination demonstrates vaginal dryness, small petechiae and loss of rugae. What is the most appropriate next step in her management?

Options:
✓ Estrogen containing vaginal pessaries/creams
  Flexible cystourethroscopy
  Outpatient hysteroscopic assessment of the endometrium.
  Transdermal continuous combined HRT
  Water based vaginal lubricants

Explanation:
The symptoms of recurrent postmenopausal and postcoital bleeding, combined with signs of vaginal dryness, petechiae, and loss of rugae, in the absence of other pathology (normal ultrasound, biopsy, smears), are highly indicative of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), or severe atrophic vaginitis. Local estrogen therapy (vaginal pessaries/creams) is the most appropriate and effective treatment.

================================================================================

  Smooth endoplasmic reticulum

Explanation:
Levothyroxine (T4) is a thyroid hormone that exerts its therapeutic effects by binding to specific nuclear receptors within the cell nucleus. This binding then regulates gene transcription, leading to changes in protein synthesis and metabolic activity.

================================================================================
Question 473 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 54-year-old diabetic man presented to OPD with complaints of dry cough over the past few days and an unexpected weight gain over the past few weeks. His diabetes is well controlled with a combination of oral antidiabetic agents. Physical examination showed evident peripheral edema, mild jugular venous distention. Which of the following drugs most likely caused the patient's signs and symptoms?

Options:
  Acarbose
  Exenatide
  Glyburide
  Metformin
✓ Pioglitazone

Explanation:
Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is known to cause fluid retention and edema as a common adverse effect. This can lead to weight gain and, in susceptible patients, contribute to or exacerbate congestive heart failure, which could manifest as jugular venous distention and peripheral edema.

================================================================================
Question 474 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 59-year-old man suffering from type 2 diabetes had been receiving an oral anti-diabetic therapy that included a drug that closes adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels on pancreatic beta-cell membranes. Which of the following drugs most likely uses this mechanism of action?

Options:
  Acarbose
✓ Glyburide
  Metformin
  Pioglitazone
  Repaglinide

Explanation:
Glyburide is a sulfonylurea, and drugs in this class act by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels on the pancreatic beta-cell membranes. This depolarization leads to calcium influx and subsequent insulin release, lowering blood glucose levels. Repaglinide (a meglitinide) also shares this mechanism.

================================================================================
Question 475 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 56 year old male patient comes for a follow up after being treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia. His urinary symptoms have improved but he now complains of dizziness when getting out of bed in the morning. His vitals and physical examination is unremarkable. keeping in mind his current complaints, which mechanism is used by the prescribed drug to cause symptomatic relief of benign prostatic hyperplasia?

Options:
✓ Antagonism at alpha 1 receptors
  Agonism at alpha 2 receptors
  Antagonism at androgen receptors
  Inhibition of 5-alpha reductase enzyme
  Competitive inhibition of dihydrotestosterone

Explanation:
The symptoms of dizziness and postural hypotension are common side effects of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (alpha-blockers) used for BPH. These drugs relieve BPH symptoms by antagonizing alpha-1 receptors in the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, causing relaxation. However, they also block alpha-1 receptors in blood vessels, leading to vasodilation and orthostatic hypotension.

================================================================================
Question 476 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
40-year-old woman's biopsy report revealed ER-positive breast cancer. She was prescribed tamoxifen in combination with aromatase inhibitor. Which of the following drug is a selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor?

Options:
✓ Anastrazole
  Clomiphene
  Danazol
  Finasteride
  Tamoxifen

Explanation:
Anastrazole is a selective, non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It works by blocking the enzyme aromatase, which is responsible for the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen, thereby reducing estrogen levels and inhibiting the growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers.

================================================================================
Question 477 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 56-year-old woman was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Her medical history was significant for a Serious allergic reaction to sulfamethoxazole and for recurrent urinary tract infections presently treated with Ciprofloxacin, An appropriate therapy was prescribed that included a strict diet and an oral antidiabetic drug. Which of the following drugs would be contraindicated for this patient?

Options:
  Acarbose
✓ Glimepiride
  Insulin
  Metformin
  Pioglitazone

Explanation:
Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea, and drugs in this class have a chemical structure containing a sulfonamide moiety. Therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to sulfamethoxazole (a sulfa drug) due to the potential for cross-sensitivity.

================================================================================

Options:
  Amphetamines
  High protein levels
✓ Synthetic testosterone
  Natural sugars
  Triglycerides

Explanation:
Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone, the primary male sex hormone. Their therapeutic effects in promoting muscle growth and increasing strength are mediated by their anabolic actions, which mimic those of natural testosterone.

================================================================================
Question 481 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 59-year-old woman recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes started a therapy with diet and metformin Which of the following actions most likely mediated the therapeutic effect of the drug in the patient's disease?

Options:
✓ Activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase
  Activation of glucagon-like polypeptide-I (GLP-I) receptors
  Blockade of glucagon receptors
  Blockade of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels
  Regulation of transcription of genes Involved in glucose utilization

Explanation:
Metformin's primary mechanism of action involves activating adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver. This leads to reduced hepatic glucose production, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved peripheral glucose uptake.

================================================================================
Question 482 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:

  Activation of glucagon-like polypeptide- 1 (GLP-I) receptors.
  Blockade of K channels in pancreatic beta-cell membranes.
✓ Regulation of transcription of genes related to glucose utilization
  Slowing glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract

Explanation:
Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD), acts by binding to and activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) in the cell nucleus. This activation regulates the transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, leading to increased insulin sensitivity.

================================================================================
Question 483 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old woman visited prenatal clinic and was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Two doses of Isophan (NPH) Insulin daily were advised by the gynecologist. According to the classification, how long does NPH Insulin take to work?

Options:
  60-120 mins
  3-5 hours
  7-10 hours
✓ 11-18 hours
  24-30 hours

================================================================================
Question 484 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old woman suffering from type 2 diabetes had started treatment with metformin, but the drug was poorly tolerated, and her physician decided to shift to repaglinide. Which of the following actions most likely mediated the therapeutic effect of repaglinide in the patient's disease?

Options:
  Blockade of somatostatin receptors in the pancreas
  Blockade of glucagon receptors
  Blockade of beta 2 receptors in the liver
  Decreased glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
✓ Stimulation of insulin release

Explanation:
Repaglinide is a meglitinide, a class of rapid-acting insulin secretagogues. It works by stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels, similar to sulfonylureas, but with a faster onset and shorter duration of action.

================================================================================
Question 485 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old woman was admitted as an inpatient with urosepsis and an acute kidney injury (AKI). Her Potassium level is 6.8 mg/dl. The trainee medical officer on duty asks you to give calcium gluconate to this patient. What's the role of calcium gluconate the management of hyperkalemia?

Options:
  Decrease potassium levels by unknown mechanism
  Increase gastrointestinal loss of potassium
  Increase renal excretion of potassium
  Intracellular shift of potassium
✓ Stabilization of cardiac membrane

Explanation:
In severe hyperkalemia, especially with ECG changes (like tall T-waves), intravenous calcium gluconate is administered to stabilize the cardiac membrane. It does not lower potassium levels but antagonizes the cardiotoxic effects of high potassium, reducing the risk of fatal arrhythmias.

================================================================================
Question 486 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
55-year-old woman was admitted with recurrent severe hyperkalemia, that only transiently improve with insulin and dextrose infusions. She takes no regular medications and has no significant past medical history What would be an additional prescription to help prevent this recurrence?

Options:
  Calcium gluconate
✓ Calcium resonium
  Furosemide
  Magnesium supplementation
  Spironolactone

Explanation:
For recurrent severe hyperkalemia that is only transiently improved by intracellular shifts (like with insulin and dextrose), agents that remove potassium from the body are needed. Calcium resonium (sodium polystyrene sulfonate) is an ion-exchange resin that binds potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, promoting its excretion and helping prevent recurrence.

================================================================================
Question 487 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You are consulted on a 28-year-old man with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria of 1.2 g/day . His BP 134/84 mmHg with a heart rate of 70 BPM. His creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL. He has no other symptoms. Which one of the following medications you recommend to improve his proteinuria?

Options:
  Amlodipine
  Atenolol
  Chlorthalidone
✓ Lisinopril
  Prednisone

Explanation:
Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is a first-line therapy for patients with proteinuria, such as in IgA nephropathy. ACE inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure by dilating the efferent arterioles, thereby decreasing protein excretion and preserving renal function.

================================================================================
Question 488 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Cytogenetics studies performed on a renal tumor demonstrate the presence of terminal deletion of the arm of chromosome 3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? VHL.

Options:
  Collecting duct carcinoma
  Oncocytoma
  Renal cell carcinoma chromophobe type
✓ Renal cell carcinoma clear cell type
  Renal cell carcinoma papillary type

Explanation:
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is strongly associated with genetic alterations involving the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p). Terminal deletion of 3p is a common cytogenetic finding in ccRCC.

================================================================================
Question 489 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A male patient presents to the OPD with complaint of swelling of left testicle. Ultrasound scan showed a mass protruding from pole of testicle. Biopsy of the lesion showed classic perivascular structures which are seen in yolk sac tumours. These lesions are called?

Options:
  Call-Exner bodies
  Michaelis-Guttmann bodies
  Port caval shunts
✓ Schiller-Duval bodies
  Russel bodies

Explanation:
Schiller-Duval bodies are characteristic histological structures found in yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors). They are glomeruloid-like structures consisting of a central capillary surrounded by a layer of tumor cells within a cystic space.

================================================================================
Question 490 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A feature of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma is:

Options:
  Association with tuberous sclerosis
✓ Good prognosis
  High prevalence of 3p deletion
  Mean age at diagnosis of 25 years
  Tendency for renal vein Invasion

Explanation:
Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma typically has a better prognosis compared to clear cell or papillary renal cell carcinomas. It is less commonly associated with 3p deletion (which is characteristic of clear cell RCC), and while it can occur at various ages, it's not typically diagnosed at 25 years.

================================================================================
Question 491 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old boy was prescribed some medicine for fever, sore throat and joint pains. He was completely fine, but after two weeks he suddenly developed fever, hematuria and rash on body. His serum creatinine was also elevated. The blood film and urine R/E will most likely show these blood cells.

Options:
  Basophils
✓ Eosinophils
  Lymphocytes
  Neutrophils
  Pus cells

Explanation:
This clinical picture (fever, rash, arthralgia, acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine, and hematuria developing after drug exposure) is highly suggestive of acute interstitial nephritis, often drug-induced. A characteristic feature of drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis is the presence of eosinophils in the blood (eosinophilia) and urine (eosinophiluria).

================================================================================
Question 492 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A biopsy of the 2.0 cm exophytic bladder tumor of a 57 years old man show papillary structures lined by more than 10 layers of epithelial cells. Nuclear Atypia is moderate, mitosis are rare and there are foci of necrosis. The neoplasm infiltrates the underlying muscularis mucosa. Which of the following is the most important parameter influencing the prognosis?

Options:
  Cell layers
✓ Infiltration of the muscularis
  Mitosis
  Necrosis
  Nuclear Atypia

Explanation:
The most important prognostic factor for bladder cancer is the depth of invasion, specifically whether the tumor has invaded the muscularis propria (detrusor muscle). Infiltration of the muscularis mucosa, while concerning, indicates a stage that is still superficial to the main muscle layer. However, compared to other features listed (cell layers, mitosis, necrosis, atypia), any invasion, especially beyond the superficial layers, is crucial for prognosis. If 'muscularis mucosa' refers to invasion into the lamina propria but *not* yet the detrusor muscle, then the presence of *any* infiltration beyond the epithelium is a significant step in staging. In general, invasion into the muscle layer is the critical prognostic discriminator for recurrence and progression. Assuming the options highlight the *most* important prognostic factor, 'infiltration of the muscularis' (referring to the muscularis propria, or at least any invasive component beyond the lamina propria) is generally paramount.

================================================================================
Question 493 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A histopathologist is examining renal biopsy specimen of a 54 years old male with long standing history of uncontrolled hypertension. He notices that capsule is adherent to cortical surface. Kidney surface is fine granular and shows V-shaped areas of scarring. What is the possible cause of these findings?

Options:
  Glomerulonephritis
  Malignant hypertension
✓ Nephrosclerosis (specifically Benign Nephrosclerosis)
  Nephrotic syndrome
  Renal artery sclerosis

Explanation:
The findings described (adherent capsule, fine granular kidney surface, V-shaped scarring) in a patient with long-standing uncontrolled hypertension are characteristic features of benign nephrosclerosis, which results from chronic ischemia due to arteriolosclerosis.

================================================================================
Question 494 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old male patient was diagnosed as having bladder carcinoma. Which of the most important predisposing condition for the development of bladder cancer?

Options:
  Arylamine exposure
✓ Cigarette smoking
  Cyclophosphamide treatment
  Human papilloma virus infection
  Schistosoma hematobium infection

Explanation:
Cigarette smoking is the single most important risk factor for the development of bladder cancer, accounting for a significant proportion of cases. While other factors like arylamine exposure (occupational), cyclophosphamide, and *Schistosoma haematobium* (especially in endemic areas) are also risk factors, smoking is globally the most prevalent and significant.

================================================================================
Question 495 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:

================================================================================

Question:
A 13 years old boy is seen because of increasing weakness, easy fatigability, and weight loss over the past 90 days. In addition he has developed nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. His blood pressure is markedly decreased, he has increased pigmentation of his skin creases. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Addison's Disease
  Hypogonadism
  Hypoparathyroidism
  Hypopituitarism
  Hypothyroidism

Explanation:
The constellation of symptoms including increasing weakness, fatigability, weight loss, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), hypotension, and particularly increased skin pigmentation (especially in creases) is classic for primary adrenal insufficiency, known as Addison's Disease.

================================================================================
Question 497 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old male patients resents to emergency unit with complaint of inability to pass urine. On examination, the bladder is found fully distended. On Digital rectal examination, the prostate if found to be abnormally enlarged. Biopsy of the prostate was advised which showed benign prostatic hyperplasia. Which zone of prostate is most likely effected by prostatic hyperplasia?

Options:
  Capsule of prostate
  Entire prostate
  Periurethral prostate
  Peripheral prostate
✓ Transitional zone of prostate

Explanation:
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) predominantly affects the transitional zone of the prostate, which surrounds the urethra. The enlargement of this zone causes compression of the urethra, leading to lower urinary tract symptoms like difficulty passing urine.

================================================================================
Question 498 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old woman is seen by her gynecologist 8 months after giving birth to a normal infant. She suffered severe cervical lacerations during delivery, resulting in hemorrhagic shock Following blood transfusion and surgical repair, postpartum recovery has so far been uneventful. She now complains of continued amenorrhea and loss of weight and muscle strength. What is the Diagnosis?

Options:
  Androgen excess
  Diabetes Insipidus
  Hyperprolactinemia
  Primary Hypothyroidism
✓ Sheehan syndrome

Explanation:
The history of severe postpartum hemorrhage, followed by amenorrhea and symptoms of general pituitary insufficiency (weight loss, loss of muscle strength, often including inability to lactate), is characteristic of Sheehan's syndrome (postpartum pituitary necrosis).

================================================================================
Question 499 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 34 years old woman is seen because of unexplained weight gain, selectively over the trunk, upper back & neck, irregular menstrual periods. She is especially concerned about the changing contour of her face, which has become rounder moon shaped. She has male pattern hair growth, elevated blood pressure and blood glucose. Abdominal CT Scan reveal smooth homogeneous lesion in left adrenal gland. Which of the following Investigations will be needed for diagnosis of the above disease?

Options:
✓ Cortisol
  GH
  LH and FSH
  Prolactin
  TSH

Explanation:
The clinical presentation (truncal obesity, moon face, hirsutism, irregular periods, hypertension, elevated blood glucose) and the adrenal lesion on CT scan are classic for Cushing's syndrome, specifically an ACTH-independent adrenal adenoma. The primary investigation needed to confirm hypercortisolism is measurement of cortisol (e.g., 24-hour urine free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, or low-dose dexamethasone suppression test).

================================================================================
Question 500 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

A 60 year old male with a history of Type 1 diabetes loses consciousness during the course of a dental treatment. What can be the most likely cause?

Options:
  Addisonian crisis
  Anaphylaxis
✓ Hypoglycemia
  Hyperglycemia
  Cushing Syndrome

Explanation:
In a patient with Type 1 diabetes, losing consciousness during a procedure (like dental treatment) is most likely due to hypoglycemia, especially if they have taken their insulin but their food intake or activity levels were altered. Hypoglycemia is a common and dangerous complication of insulin therapy.

================================================================================
Question 501 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old woman complains of itching and scaling of the right breast nipple area, which on biopsy is confirmed as Paget's disease. On further work-up, a 2cm in diameter palpable mass is noted under the skin of the nipple. Which of the following is likely to be an association?

Options:
✓ Infiltrating ductal carcinoma
  Lobular carcinoma in situ
  Invasive lobular carcinoma
  Intraductal papilloma
  Fibroadenoma

Explanation:
Paget's disease of the nipple is a rare form of breast cancer that almost always signals an underlying invasive carcinoma, most commonly an infiltrating ductal carcinoma, or ductal carcinoma in situ. The presence of a palpable mass under the nipple strongly suggests an underlying invasive malignancy.

================================================================================
Question 502 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Thyroxin binding globulins (TBGs) is one of three transport proteins responsible for carrying the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine in the bloodstream and have effect on Thyroid function tests. Which of the following conditions can lead to increase level of abnormal (TBGs)?

Options:
  Acromegaly
  Hypothyroidism
  Malabsorption
  Malnutrition
✓ Pregnancy

Explanation:
Pregnancy leads to increased estrogen levels, which stimulate the liver to produce more thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). This increases the total (bound) thyroid hormone levels but free thyroid hormone levels usually remain normal.

================================================================================
Question 503 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A palpable mass is noted in right lobe of thyroid of a 45 years old man along with enlargement of cervical lymph nodes. Histopathological study reveal tumor cells having ground glass appearance Orphan Annie) nuclei. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Anaplastic carcinoma
  Follicular carcinoma
  Medullary carcinoma
✓ Papillary carcinoma
  Papillary carcinoma (Option D & E duplicate)

Explanation:
The histopathological description of tumor cells with 'ground glass appearance' and 'Orphan Annie eye' nuclei are classic cytological features of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The presence of a palpable mass and enlarged cervical lymph nodes also aligns with this diagnosis, as papillary carcinoma frequently metastasizes to regional lymph nodes.

================================================================================
Question 504 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 year old Male comes to the ER with severe lower abdominal pain which accompanied with nausea and vomiting fever for 1 day and he says he got no relief when he took paracetamol He is also complaining of pain during urination. Which of the following investigations will you perform first to confirm your diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Abdomino-pelvic Ultrasound to visualize Kidney, Ureters, bladder
  Blood CP
  Blood culture
  Infective markers
  Urine Culture

Explanation:
Given the symptoms of severe lower abdominal pain, dysuria (painful urination), and lack of relief, along with nausea and vomiting, the most appropriate initial investigation to visualize potential pathologies like appendicitis, ureteric stone (causing renal colic and radiating pain), or other genitourinary issues would be an abdomino-pelvic ultrasound.

================================================================================
Question 505 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Calcium is the most abundant cation found in the human body and plays an integral role in neural transmission, enzyme activity, myocardial function, coagulation and other cellular functions. Which of the following disease can lead to hypercalcemia?

Options:
✓ Hyperparathyroidism
  Pancreatitis
  Malignant disease
  Sarcoidosis
  Thyrotoxicosis

Explanation:
Hyperparathyroidism (primary or tertiary) is a common cause of hypercalcemia, as the parathyroid glands secrete excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to increased bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption. Malignant disease and sarcoidosis are also important causes of hypercalcemia.

================================================================================
Question 506 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Glucose tolerance test can be done in pregnancy to screen for gestational diabetes. Which other condition this test is employed for?

Options:
✓ Acromegaly
  Adrenal hypofunctions
  Hypathyroidism
  Hyperparathyroidism
  Pituitary Atrophy

Explanation:
An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not only used to diagnose diabetes but also as a diagnostic test for acromegaly. In healthy individuals, glucose administration suppresses growth hormone (GH) secretion; in acromegaly, GH levels fail to suppress appropriately during an OGTT.

================================================================================
Question 507 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An acutely ill 20 years old female student is brought to emergency with fever, hypotension and obtunded mental status. Numerous petechiae and purpuric hemorrhages are scattered over the trunk. Gram stain reveals gram-negative diplococci. Serum sodium is markedly decreased while serum potassium is increased. APTT and d-Dimers are increased. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute kidney failure
  Addison Disease
  Disseminated intravascular coagulation
  Hemophilia
✓ Waterhouse Friderichsen Syndrome

Explanation:
The clinical picture of overwhelming sepsis (fever, hypotension, obtundation) with widespread petechiae and purpuric hemorrhages, adrenal insufficiency (low sodium, high potassium), and coagulopathy (increased APTT and D-dimers) caused by Gram-negative diplococci (suggesting *Neisseria meningitidis*) is classic for Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome, which involves bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and acute adrenal crisis.

================================================================================
Question 508 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 36 year old man is brought to the emergency department because of lethargy, weakness, and confusion Serum sodium and plasma osmolarity are markedly decreased while urine osmolality is increased What is most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Conn syndrome
  Cushing syndrome
  Sheehan syndrome
✓ SIAD syndrome
  Nephrotic syndrome.

Explanation:
The combination of hyponatremia (decreased serum sodium), low plasma osmolarity, and inappropriately high urine osmolality (concentrated urine despite hypotonic plasma) is the diagnostic hallmark of the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) secretion. The symptoms of lethargy, weakness, and confusion are consistent with hyponatremia.

================================================================================
Question 509 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:

Options:
  ABO blood group
✓ Human Leukocyte Antigen
  Immunoglobulin A
  Major Histocompatibility complex
  Rhesus antigen

Explanation:
Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matching is crucial for kidney transplantation. HLA genes are located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and encode proteins that play a vital role in immune recognition. Matching HLA antigens between donor and recipient significantly reduces the risk of transplant rejection.

Question 512 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old man presented to a dentist with dental problems. The dentist referred him to a physician for his increased frequency of headaches he is also complaining of change in his ring size and lately his shoe size has increased On examination he is 5 feet 10 Inches. Blood pressure 170/100 mmHg. He has large Duffy hands, macroglossia, Increased spaces between teeth, prognathism and frontal bossing. The physician investigated him and found him to be acromegalic with increased Growth hormones and IGF-1 and inability to suppress Growth hormone on OGTT His pituitary MRI is showing 1.7 cm adenoma and his perimetry is normal What is the best treatment option?

Options:
  Cabergoline
  Pegvisomant
  Pituitary Irradiation
✓ Transphenoidal surgery
  Wait and repeat tests after six months

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation (acromegalic features, hypertension), biochemical profile (high GH/IGF-1, non-suppressible GH), and pituitary adenoma on MRI strongly indicate active acromegaly. Transsphenoidal surgery is considered the first-line and most effective treatment for removing pituitary adenomas causing acromegaly, aiming for biochemical cure and symptom improvement.

Question 513 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32-year-old woman attends her GP with weight loss and tremors. On questioning, she also reports loose stools and increasing anxiety. She has a past medical history of type 1 diabetes. You suspected Grave's disease in the patient. Which antibody test you will order to support your diagnosis?

Options:
  Anti 21-hydroxylase anti body
  Anti parietal cell antibody
  Antigliadin Antibodies
  Thyroid peroxidase Antibodies
✓ Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody

Explanation:
The symptoms (weight loss, tremors, loose stools, anxiety) and suspicion of Graves' disease are highly indicative of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHR-Ab or TRAb) are specific to Graves' disease and stimulate the TSH receptor, leading to excessive thyroid hormone production. This is the most appropriate antibody test for confirming Graves' disease.

================================================================================
Question 514 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old man came to medical OPD with symptoms of recurrent episodes of watery diarrhea, associated with crampy abdominal pain and hot flushes... On examination, pulse was 80/minute, BP 140/80 (lying), and 120/70 (standing) Chest: bilateral wheezes CVS: pan systolic murmur along the left sternal border What is the diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Carcinoid Syndrome
  Coeliac disease
  Giardiasis
  IBS
  Congestive heart failure

Explanation:
The constellation of symptoms including recurrent watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, hot flushes, bilateral wheezes (bronchospasm), and a pansystolic murmur (suggesting carcinoid heart disease) is highly characteristic of carcinoid syndrome, which results from the release of vasoactive substances (e.g., serotonin) from neuroendocrine tumors.

Question 516 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 year old female presents to the OPD with history of worsening headache, weight gain and generalized weakness. She also turned out to be hypertensive and raised blood sugar levels on a couple of occasions. An Overnight dexamethasone suppression test was done which showed no cortisol suppression. What is the most commonest cause of above mentioned symptoms and test?

Options:
  Conn's syndrome
✓ Cushing's Disease
  Phaeochromocytoma
  Small cell lung cancer
  Thyroid carcinoma

Explanation:
The symptoms (headache, weight gain, weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia) and the result of the overnight dexamethasone suppression test (no cortisol suppression) strongly suggest Cushing's syndrome. The most common endogenous cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's Disease, which is due to an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma.

================================================================================

What relevant Investigations will you perform in this case?

Options:
  ACTH
  GH
  GTT
  LH & FSH
✓ TFTs

Explanation:
The symptoms described (decline in academic performance, lower voice pitch, coarsening hair, weight gain, menorrhagia, cold intolerance) are classic for hypothyroidism. Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs), including TSH and thyroid hormones, are the primary investigations to diagnose this condition.

================================================================================
Question 521 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Thyroid function tests (TFTs) Include T3,T4 and TSH. Name 1st line single test for thyroid function evaluation?

Options:
  Free T4
  Free T3

================================================================================
Question 522 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) of a 48 year old senior male officer during his "Annual Check-up" was found to be 142 mg/dl. He was advised re-testing for DM by Glycosylated Heamoglobin (A1C). The result of A1C was found to be 6.8% (HPLC) Now he wants your opinion. Keeping in view the latest recommendations by International bodies (and ignoring the social aspects for the time being, at least) which of the following you think is the best option for this patient:

Options:
✓ DM is confirmed
  Requires repeating of FPG
  Requires repeating of A1C
  Requires OGTT
  Requires Urinalysis

Explanation:
According to diagnostic criteria for diabetes, an FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL or an HbA1c ≥ 6.5% confirms the diagnosis. This patient has both an FPG of 142 mg/dL (above 126) and an HbA1c of 6.8% (above 6.5%), meeting the criteria for diabetes on two separate tests.

================================================================================
Question 523 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26 years old woman has episodic hypertension with headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations. MRI scan showed Adrenal tumors arising from medulla What urinary lab investigation can confirm the diagnosis?

Options:
  Urinary protein creatinin ratio
  24 hours urinary ketosteroids
  24 hour urinary proteins
  Urinary Albumin
✓ Vinyl Mandilic acid (VMA)

Explanation:
The symptoms (episodic hypertension, headache, diaphoresis, palpitations) and adrenal medullary tumor are classic for pheochromocytoma. This tumor secretes catecholamines, and its diagnosis is confirmed by measuring urinary metanephrines and normetanephrines, or their breakdown product, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), in a 24-hour urine collection.

================================================================================
Question 524 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old woman presents with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and visual field defects all of several months duration, MRI reveals a hypophyseal mass impinging on optic chiasm. Which hormone would be found in high concentration in serum?

Options:
  ACTH
  GH
  LH and FSH
✓ Prolactin
  TSH

Explanation:
The combination of amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and visual field defects (due to optic chiasm compression by a hypophyseal mass) is classic for a prolactinoma, a pituitary tumor that secretes excessive prolactin. Therefore, prolactin would be found in high concentration in the serum.

================================================================================
Question 525 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following tests can be used to assess kidney functions at tubular level?

Options:
  Calculation of GFR
  Creatinine clearance
  Cystatin C
✓ Fractional excretion of Na
  Serum Urea

Explanation:
Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is a useful test for assessing kidney function at the tubular level. It helps differentiate between prerenal azotemia (low FENa, indicating intact tubular function to reabsorb sodium) and acute tubular necrosis (high FENa, indicating tubular damage and impaired sodium reabsorption).

================================================================================
Question 526 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 54 years old woman is concerned about swelling in left Breast on examination there is 4x5cm lump in upper inner quadrant of left breast there is also a single mobile lymph node palpable in left axilla the contralateral side and axilla are normal what is the next appropriate management option?

Options:
  Fine needle aspiration cytology
✓ Triple assessment
  Reassurance and close follow up
  MRI of breast
  Ultrasound of breast

Explanation:
Any new breast lump, especially with associated lymphadenopathy, requires a 'triple assessment' which includes clinical examination, imaging (mammography and/or ultrasound), and tissue sampling (fine needle aspiration cytology or core biopsy). This comprehensive approach provides the most accurate diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 527 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 62-year-old male presents to the OPD complaining that, he has noted slight urgency, frequency, nocturia, a decrease in the force of micturition. He is referred to have blood tests to include which of the following?

Options:
  Carcinoembryonic antigen
✓ Prostate specific antigen
  Carbohydrate antigen 19
  Lactate Dehydrogenase
  Alkaline phosphatase

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (urgency, frequency, nocturia, decreased force of micturition) are classic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) often associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer in older men. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a blood test commonly used to screen for and monitor prostate conditions, including cancer.

================================================================================
Question 528 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old man is distressed by severe backache due to metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. Which of the following is the appropriate treatment?

Options:
  Radiotherapy
✓ Subcapsular Orchidectomy
  Radical Prostatectomy
  Palliative Chemotherapy
  Brachytherapy

Explanation:
Prostate cancer is often androgen-dependent. For metastatic prostate carcinoma, androgen deprivation therapy is a cornerstone of treatment. Subcapsular orchidectomy (surgical removal of the testes) is a very effective and rapid method of achieving surgical castration, thereby reducing testosterone levels and slowing disease progression, particularly for bone metastases causing pain.

================================================================================
Question 529 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A surgical resident is asked by the consultant to perform a staging workup for a lady with invasive ductal carcinoma having a 5x5 cm lump in left breast with peau d'orange skin, which of the following is the correct step?

Options:
  CT scan Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis
✓ CT scan chest, abdomen, and pelvis and bone scan
  MRI of breast
  MRI of chest
  Positron Emission Tomography CT scan

Explanation:
The presence of a large invasive ductal carcinoma with 'peau d'orange' (suggesting inflammatory breast cancer or advanced local disease) indicates a high likelihood of metastatic spread. A comprehensive staging workup requires imaging to detect distant metastases, typically including a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, along with a bone scan to assess for bone metastases.

================================================================================
Question 530 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42 years old female presents to the OPD with pain in the right upper quadrant. Ultrasound examination reveals a 5x5 cm mass in the lower pole of right kidney What is the next appropriate investigation?

Options:
  Intravenous Urogram
  X-ray KUB
✓ CT scan abdomen
  Diagnostic Laparoscopy
  MRI abdomen

Explanation:
For a newly discovered solid renal mass, particularly one of this size (5x5 cm), a CT scan of the abdomen (with and without contrast) is the most appropriate next investigation. It provides detailed anatomical information, helps characterize the mass (e.g., solid vs. cystic, benign vs. malignant features), and assesses for local invasion or lymphadenopathy.

================================================================================
Question 531 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 24 years old woman presented to the OPD with painless lump in her right breast. On examination, there is a 2x2 cm firm mobile swelling in upper outer quadrant of right breast. What is the next step in management?

Options:
  Fine needle aspiration cytology
✓ Mammography
  Reassurance and follow up
  Core Cut biopsy
  Excision of the lump

Explanation:
For a 24-year-old woman with a painless, firm, mobile breast lump, the next step is typically imaging. While ultrasound is often preferred for younger women, mammography is also a standard part of the 'triple assessment' in many guidelines, especially as the lump is firm. This would be followed by biopsy if suspicious. Given the options, mammography is a key diagnostic imaging step, often combined with ultrasound.

================================================================================
Question 532 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
All children with type 1 diabetes mellitus require insulin therapy most require 2 or more injections of insulin daily with doses adjusted on the basis of self monitoring of blood glucose levels the preferable insulin regimen is:

Options:
  Conventional Insulin therapy: Twice daily mixed Insulin
  Mixed Insulin breakfast + evening meal and mid day short acting insulin.
  Intermediate acting breakfast + evening meal and three times short
  Short acting breakfast+ lunch and mixture of short acting and intermediate acting at evening meal
✓ Rapid acting before breakfast+ lunch + evening meal+ long acting before bedtime

Explanation:
The most preferable insulin regimen for Type 1 diabetes is often a basal-bolus regimen, mimicking physiological insulin secretion. This involves rapid-acting insulin before each meal (breakfast, lunch, evening meal) to cover carbohydrate intake, combined with a long-acting insulin before bedtime (or once daily) to provide basal insulin coverage.

================================================================================
Question 533 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 54-year-old woman presents systemically unwell with high grade fever and sore throat. She has recently started carbimazole for hyperthyroidism, What is the most important blood test to perform?

Options:
  Cortisol
✓ Full blood count
  Liver function tests
  Prothrombin time
  Urea and electrolytes

Explanation:
Carbimazole, an antithyroid drug, has a rare but serious side effect of agranulocytosis (a severe drop in white blood cell count). A high-grade fever and sore throat in a patient on carbimazole are red flags for this condition, necessitating an urgent full blood count (CBC) to check for neutropenia.

================================================================================
Question 534 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20-year-old athletic man with no significant past medical history is found to have isolated asymptomatic microscopic haematuria on routine physical exam. He is not on any medications and does not use illicit drugs. Which one of the following observations suggests haematuria of glomerular origin?

Options:
  Abscense of RBC and WBC casts.
  Decoy cells in urine sediment
✓ Dysmorphic RBCs of acanthocytes in urine sediment
  Isomorphic red blood cells (RBCs) in urine sediment
  Isomorphic RBCs and white blood cells (WBCs) in urine sediment

Explanation:
Hematuria of glomerular origin (e.g., from glomerulonephritis) is characterized by dysmorphic red blood cells (RBCs), particularly acanthocytes, and often RBC casts in the urine sediment. These indicate that the RBCs have been distorted as they passed through damaged glomeruli.

================================================================================
Question 535 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old school going student presented to emergency deptt with chief complaints of vomiting abdominal pain and increased urinary frequency for the last three days. On examination his blood pressure is 100/80mg Hg, pulse rate is 102 beats per minute and regular. His skin is dry and flushed. These investigations are available at the moment. Random blood sugar 350 mg/dl; Blood PH 7.25; serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dl; Serum ketones positives. What is the best First line treatment for this patient?

Options:
  IV bicarbonate
✓ IV 0.9% Normal Saline
  IV antibiotics
  IV 0.45% Dextrose Saline
  S/C Heparin

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain, increased urinary frequency, dry/flushed skin, tachycardia), and lab results (random blood sugar 350 mg/dl, pH 7.25, positive serum ketones) are classic for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The best first-line treatment for DKA is aggressive intravenous (IV) 0.9% normal saline to correct severe dehydration and restore intravascular volume.

================================================================================
Question 536 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with nausea, vomiting, severe flank pain, and hematuria Which one of the following diagnostic images is APPROPRIATE in this subject?

Options:
  A plain film of the abdomen (KUB)
  An ultrasound of the kidneys
  An intravenous urogram
✓ An unenhanced helical (spiral) CT of abdomen
  An MRI

Explanation:
The symptoms (nausea, vomiting, severe flank pain, hematuria) are classic for renal colic, usually caused by kidney stones. An unenhanced helical (spiral) CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the most appropriate and sensitive diagnostic imaging modality for detecting urinary tract calculi.

================================================================================
Question 537 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 24 year old thin, lean female presented to the opd with dizziness and depressive symptoms. She was also complaining of abdominal pain with episodes of vomiting. On examination she had dark brown complexion and her BP was 90/60, Keeping the history in mind what is the most specific investigation you would like to do?

Options:
  Blood glucose level
  Serum Calcium
  Thyroid function tests
  Serum ferritin
✓ Synacthen test

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (dizziness, depressive symptoms, abdominal pain, vomiting, low BP, and especially a dark brown complexion (hyperpigmentation)) are highly suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). The most specific diagnostic investigation for this condition is the Synacthen test (ACTH stimulation test), which assesses the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol.

================================================================================
Question 538 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young male presented to ER with history of repeated sexual assaults upon local examination thickened and shiny silver hyper keratinized skin was founds around perianal region. Anus was deeply situated A foreign residue assumed to be having same consistency as of lubricant was found, Upon DRE anal canal was dilated with lax anal sphincter. Which of the following option best applies to the above findings?

Options:
  Bestiality
  Habitual active agent of sodomy
✓ Habitual passive agent of sodomy
  Lesbian
  Voyeurism

Explanation:
The physical findings described (thickened, hyperkeratinized perianal skin, deeply situated anus, dilated/lax anal sphincter, foreign residue/lubricant) are classic for a habitual passive agent of sodomy, indicative of chronic receptive anal intercourse.

================================================================================
Question 539 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young lady had been pregnant under surrogacy contract for 9months and then delivered a healthy baby. After delivery she refused baby to handover to actual parents against the contract. What is the most suitable option among the following given below?

Options:
  Breach of child
  Cancellation of contract
✓ Commercial transaction
  Disagreement
  Revoking of contract

Explanation:
In many legal systems, particularly in Pakistan, commercial surrogacy is prohibited, and any contract related to it may be considered illegal or unenforceable. The refusal to hand over the baby highlights the ethical and legal complexities of such a commercial transaction, especially when it involves payment for a child.

================================================================================
Question 540 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Police has brought a middle-aged woman in an alleged case of concealment of birth. On examination she has enlarged breasts exuding colostrum, Montgomery's tubercles present. Uterus is relaxed flabby and at umbilical level Lochia rubra is present in the vaginal canal. According to examination findings how many days have been passed since she has delivered the baby?

Options:
  1 day
✓ 2-3 days
  4-5 days
  6 days
  1 week

Explanation:
The presence of lochia rubra typically lasts for the first 3-4 days postpartum. A relaxed, flabby uterus at the umbilical level indicates recent delivery, usually within the first few days. Colostrum and Montgomery's tubercles are consistent with the puerperal state. Thus, 2-3 days is the most consistent timeframe.

================================================================================
Question 541 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Police has caught a renal transplant surgeon red handed for doing illegal renal transplants in a private setup. He now has been charged with violation of human tissue and organ transplant act. According to human organ transplant act of Pakistan what penalty he could face?

Options:
  Hydrocortisone
✓ Dexamethasone
  Methylprednisolone
  Glucocorticoids
  Triamcinolone

Explanation:
Dexamethasone is a long-acting glucocorticoid that is significantly more potent (about 25-30 times) than hydrocortisone, making it one of the most potent options available.

================================================================================
Question 544 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old male patient was admitted in cardiology ward with symptoms of blood in urine, flank pain, lethargy and weight loss. Renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed on MRI. The cytogenetics studies was performed on a renal tumor which demonstrated the presence of terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Collecting duct carcinoma
  Oncocytoma
  Renal cell carcinoma chromophobe type
✓ Renal cell carcinoma clear cell type
  Renal cell carcinoma papillary type

Explanation:
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is strongly associated with the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p), which involves the VHL gene. This is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in ccRCC.

================================================================================
Question 545 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65-year-old woman attends a clinic with a large prolapse she underwent abdominal hysterectomy at the age of 42 for heavy periods, and required a second operation for a large left-sided ovarian cyst which was complicated by dense abdominal adhesions. She has no other significant history. On examination she had a vaginal vault prolapse that extended beyond the introitus and also had a vaginal wall tear. She is married and wishes to resume her marital relationship with her husband. What is the best option for treatment for this patient? Choose the single best answer.

Options:
  Abdominal sacrocolpopexy
  Antero-posterior repair
  Colpocleisis
  Insertion of a vaginal pessary
✓ Vaginal repair with sacrospinous fixation

Explanation:
Given the patient's history of dense abdominal adhesions from previous surgeries, an abdominal approach (sacrocolpopexy) carries higher risk. She wishes to maintain sexual function, so colpocleisis (closing the vagina) is contraindicated. A vaginal repair with sacrospinous fixation effectively addresses the vault prolapse while preserving vaginal depth and avoiding the risks of re-entering the abdomen.

================================================================================
Question 546 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12 years old boy was brought to paediatrician with history of fever, sorethroat and joint pains. He was prescribed medicine and sent home. The boy was completely fine, but after two weeks he suddenly developed fever, hematuria and pain in body. Lab investigations revealed raised serum creatinine. Which of the following cells can be seen in the blood film and urine R/E in this case?

Options:
  Basophils
✓ Eosinophils
  Lymphocytes
  Neutrophils
  Pus cells

Explanation:
The clinical picture of fever, hematuria, and acute kidney injury (raised creatinine) developing a few weeks after taking medication for a sore throat suggests Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN), likely drug-induced. A classic finding in drug-induced AIN is eosinophilia in the blood and eosinophiluria (eosinophils in the urine).

================================================================================
Question 547 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 17 years old thin lean girl has not started menarche. On complete workup no cause found. What is the condition known as?

Options:
  Menopause
  Hysterectomy
✓ Constitutional delay
  Premature ovarian failure
  Hermaphrodite

Explanation:
Primary amenorrhea (failure to start menarche by age 15 or 16 with normal secondary sexual characteristics, or by 13 without them) in a thin, lean girl with no identifiable pathological cause after workup is often attributed to constitutional delay of growth and puberty. Being thin/lean can also contribute (functional hypothalamic amenorrhea), but 'Constitutional delay' is the diagnosis for unexplained late menarche in this context.

================================================================================
Question 548 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old male patient with a history of BPH is prescribed medication to manage his symptoms. Which class of medications is commonly used to treat BPH by relaxing the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck?

Options:
  Antibiotics
✓ Alpha-blockers
  Anticholinergics
  Beta-blockers
  Antimuscarinics

Explanation:
Alpha-blockers (alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists) work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate gland and bladder neck, thereby improving urine flow and reducing BPH symptoms.

================================================================================

  Cystitis
✓ Pyelonephritis

Explanation:
The constellation of high fever, rigors (shivering), vomiting, flank pain/loin tenderness (backache), and urinary symptoms (frequency, dysuria) with positive urinalysis (leukocytes, nitrites) strongly points to acute pyelonephritis, an upper urinary tract infection.

================================================================================
Question 550 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old patient is receiving a kidney transplant from a living donor, who is a close family member. What is this type of transplant called?

Options:
  Autograft
  Isograft
  Xenograft
✓ Allograft
  Heterograft

Explanation:
A transplant between genetically non-identical individuals of the same species (like family members or unrelated humans) is called an Allograft (or homograft). An Isograft is between genetically identical individuals (twins). The marked option 'B' in source might be incorrect if they are not identical twins.

================================================================================
Question 551 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15-year-old girl presented to gynae OPD with no menses. Ultrasound confirms blind vaginal vault with absence uterus and cervix. What test would be most useful in this patient?

Options:
  B HCG
✓ Karyotyping
  Serum TSH
  Alpha fetoprotein levels
  Beta HCG

Explanation:
The findings of primary amenorrhea with an absent uterus and cervix and a blind vaginal pouch (Mullerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome vs. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome) require Karyotyping to differentiate between a genetic female (46,XX - MRKH) and a genetic male (46,XY - AIS).

================================================================================
Question 552 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old female has a negative metastatic workup for carcinoma cervix. Her local examination shows a growth in the cervix extending beyond the cervix and involving the vagina (but not lower third) and attaches the parametrium but not reaching the pelvic side walls. Her preliminary clinical stage is which of the following?

Options:
  IA
  IB
  IIA
✓ IIB
  IIIA

Explanation:
According to FIGO staging for cervical cancer: Stage II involves extension beyond the cervix but not to the pelvic wall or lower third of vagina. IIA involves the vagina (without parametrial invasion). IIB involves the parametrium but does not reach the pelvic wall. Since the tumor 'attaches the parametrium', it is Stage IIB.

================================================================================
Question 553 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year man recently retired from fire proof textile industry developed dyspnoea while climbing stairs. On investigation, x ray showed ground glass appearance in lower two third of lung fields. Which of the following occupational disease the man suffered from?

Options:
✓ Asbestosis
  Silicosis
  Talcosis
  Siderosis
  Asbestosis

Explanation:
Asbestos exposure is common in fireproofing and textile industries. Asbestosis typically presents with dyspnea and interstitial fibrosis, often showing a ground-glass appearance or reticulonodular pattern predominantly in the lower lung zones.

================================================================================
Question 554 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 years old woman comes to surgical OPD with complaints of itching and scaling of the left breast nipple area. After taking biopsy, a 2 cm palpable mass was also noted under the skin of the nipple. The diagnosis was made to be Paget's disease. Which of the following is likely to be an association?

Options:
  Fibroadenoma
✓ Ductal carcinoma in situ
  Invasive lobular carcinoma
  Intraductal papilloma
  Tubular carcinoma

Explanation:
Paget's disease of the nipple is almost exclusively associated with an underlying breast malignancy, most commonly Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 555 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 21 year old presented to emergency department with history of vomiting and watery diarrhea for 2 days. His observations are BP 90/60 mmHg, pulse 105/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 36.9 Deg C. On examination, the patient is soft non-tender. Capillary refill is 2 seconds and his skin turgor is normal. His arterial blood gases show: pH 7.23, pCO2 15/15 and he is having a known chronic renal failure. The patient's blood test shows: K: 3.2, Ureas: 10.5, creatinine: 135 µmol/L (GFR: 45) and T.L.C: 14.8. K: 4.8 mmol/L (3.5 - 5.0). Ureas: 10.5 mmol/L (2.0 - 7.0). Creatinine: 135 µmol/L (55 - 120). With regards to this patient’s hyponatremia which of the following is the best approach?

Options:
  Encourage PO fluids
  Restriction to less than 1 litre a day
  IV 3% sodium chloride
  Oral antibiotics
✓ IV isotonic normal saline

Explanation:
Although sodium is not explicitly listed in the lab values provided in the text (likely missing data), the clinical picture of vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, and tachycardia suggests hypovolemic hyponatremia. The appropriate treatment for hypovolemic hyponatremia is volume resuscitation with IV isotonic normal saline.

================================================================================
Question 556 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old male patient presents with sudden onset sharp pain in right flank and right side of scrotum. There is associated haematuria. Ultrasound examination showed a stone impacted in ureter. Stones were removed through surgical intervention and it was later found that the patient had gout and associated hyperuricemia. What is the prevalence of uric acid stones in general population?

Options:
✓ 1-2%
  50%
  75%
  80%
  90%

Explanation:
Uric acid stones account for approximately 5-10% of all kidney stones in the general population. In patients with gout, the prevalence is much higher. Among the options, 1-2% is low, but the other options (50-90%) are far too high for the *general population*. Often cited ranges are 5-10%, so '1-2%' is likely the intended low-end distractor or there is a specific context, but generally, they are the third most common type after calcium and struvite.

================================================================================
Question 557 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Turkey was recently struck with massive earthquake. The NDMA of Pakistan has prepared building codes to cope with the underlying risk of disaster due to earthquake. Which of the following term related to disaster does not apply?

Options:
  Mitigation
  Preparedness
  Recovery
  Rehabilitation
✓ Response

Explanation:
Developing building codes to withstand earthquakes is a proactive measure taken *before* a disaster occurs to reduce its impact. This falls under Mitigation (reducing risk) or Preparedness. Response refers to the immediate actions taken *during or immediately after* the disaster to save lives. Therefore, building codes do not fall under the 'Response' phase.

================================================================================
Question 558 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 37 years old woman came to opd with 3 months amenorrhea, now complaining of pv bleeding from last 4 hrs and cramping abdominal pain. She is vitally stable and afebrile. On pelvic examination uterus is 6 weeks size, os is open and mild per vaginal bleeding seen. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Inevitable miscarriage
  Missed miscarriage
  Incomplete miscarriage
  Threatened miscarriage
  Septic miscarriage

Explanation:
The presence of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain with an *open* cervical os in a pregnancy < 24 weeks indicates that the miscarriage process has started and cannot be stopped, hence 'Inevitable miscarriage'. The uterus size (6 weeks) being smaller than dates (3 months) could suggest some products have passed or growth arrested, but the open os with ongoing bleeding/pain is the key for inevitable (or incomplete if products are passing). If products were actively passing or passed, it would be incomplete. With 'mild' bleeding and open os, Inevitable is a strong classification before expulsion.

================================================================================
Question 559 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old woman was admitted as an inpatient with urosepsis and an acute kidney injury (AKI). Throughout her admission, she had recurrent severe hyperkalemia that only transiently improve with insulin and dextrose infusions. She takes no regular medications and has no significant past medical history. What would be an additional prescription to help prevent this recurrence?

Options:
  Calcium Gluconate
✓ Calcium resonium
  Furosemide
  Magnesium supplementation
  Spironolactone

Explanation:
For recurrent hyperkalemia that responds only transiently to shifting agents (insulin/dextrose), a potassium-binding resin like Calcium Resonium (or sodium polystyrene sulfonate) is needed to actually remove potassium from the body via the gut, preventing recurrence.

================================================================================
Question 560 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 29 years old primigravida presented in 35 weeks of gestational amenorrhea with the complaint of excessive nausea and vomiting, palpitations and restlessness. Her ultrasound shows complete hydatidiform mole with Bhcg of 3,50,000. Which endocrinological condition is associated with this patient?

Options:
✓ Hyperthyroidism
  Hypothyroidism
  Hyperparathyroidism
  Hypoparathyroidism
  Sheehan’s syndrome

Explanation:
High levels of beta-hCG, as seen in molar pregnancy (hydatidiform mole), can cross-react with the TSH receptor due to structural similarity, stimulating the thyroid gland and causing secondary hyperthyroidism (gestational transient thyrotoxicosis).

================================================================================
Question 561 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38-year-old male patient presents to the family medicine clinic with complaints of heartburn and regurgitation of stomach contents into his throat, especially after meals and stress experienced during nocturnal shift and occasional hoarseness. His symptoms are relieved by antacids and proton pump inhibitors. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  GEAS
✓ GERD
  Esophageal varices
  Erosive esophagitis
  Gastric cancer

Explanation:
The symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and extra-esophageal symptoms like hoarseness (Laryngopharyngeal reflux), which are relieved by acid-suppressive therapy, are classic for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).

================================================================================
Question 562 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 years old woman comes to gyne OPD with complaints of abnormal bleeding per vaginum for the last one year. Biopsy of the endometrium sent for histopathology which revealed endometrial carcinoma. What is the risk factor for endometrial carcinoma?

Options:
✓ Polymenorrhoea
  Premenopausal years
  Premenopausal years
  Menstrual periods
  Early menopause

Explanation:
Risk factors for endometrial carcinoma are generally related to prolonged unopposed estrogen exposure. This includes nulliparity, obesity, late menopause, and irregular cycles like anovulation. Polymenorrhea (frequent cycles) could imply anovulatory cycles or hormonal imbalance contributing to risk, whereas early menopause is protective.

================================================================================
Question 563 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 33 years old woman came to the outpatient department with a lump in the left breast. The lump is soft but not mobile. There is no nipple discharge. What is the most appropriate screening test for the diagnosis of breast lump?

Options:
  Fine needle aspiration (FNA)
✓ Mammography
  MRI scan
  Core biopsy
  Self-examination

Explanation:
For a palpable breast lump in a 33-year-old, the diagnostic workup typically begins with imaging. While ultrasound is often first-line for women under 35/40, mammography is the standard 'screening' and diagnostic imaging modality mentioned in guidelines for characterizing lumps, often alongside ultrasound. Biopsy (FNA/Core) is for diagnosis, not screening.

================================================================================
Question 564 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A child of 3 years old presented with muscle wasting, loss of subcutaneous fat with no signs of edema and weight below 60% of WHO standard. The mother is unaware of not giving enough proteins and other nutrients to the child after six months. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Under nutrition
  Protein deficiency
  Marasmus & Kwashiorkor
  Under nutrition
✓ Marasmus

Explanation:
The clinical picture of severe muscle wasting, loss of subcutaneous fat, absence of edema, and very low weight (<60% standard) is the definition of Marasmus, a form of severe calorie and protein malnutrition.

================================================================================
Question 565 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old P5 has presented with excessive menstrual bleeding for the last 3 years. Clinically she is a case of anemia with Hb of 8gm/dl. You did pelvic ultrasound which shows fibroid in posterior uterine wall. Which one of the following will be expected to increase the amount of blood loss?

Options:
  Less than 50 ml
  More than 5 ml
✓ More than 80 ml
  More than 100 ml
  More than 150 ml

Explanation:
Menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding) is clinically defined as menstrual blood loss exceeding 80 ml per cycle.

================================================================================
Question 566 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 13 years old girl is brought in Gynae OPD by her mother with the complaint of irregular heavy menstrual bleed. Which she has been experiencing for last 2 years. Her full blood count shows an hb of 8gm/dl with normal platelet count. Her pelvic ultrasound is normal. What is the most likely cause of her condition?

Options:
✓ Hypothyroidism
  Hyperthyroidism
  Thrombocytopenia
  Hypopituitarism
  Ovarian cyst

Explanation:
In an adolescent girl with heavy irregular menstrual bleeding and normal pelvic ultrasound/platelets, anovulatory cycles due to immature HPO axis are common (puberty menorrhagia). However, among the options provided, Hypothyroidism is a well-known systemic cause of menorrhagia and should be screened for.

================================================================================
Question 567 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
During your MBBS class a student falls in class rank from first place to last place. She has also noted a lower pitch to her voice and coarsening of her hair along with increased tendency towards weight gain, menorrhagia and increased intolerance to cold. What relevant investigation will you perform in this case?

Options:
  ACTH
  GH
  LH
  FSH
✓ TFTs

Explanation:
The symptoms of cognitive decline (falling rank), voice change, coarse hair, weight gain, menorrhagia, and cold intolerance are classic signs of hypothyroidism. Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs) are the primary investigation.

================================================================================
Question 568 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old patient with history of diabetes for the last 3 years presents with abdominal mass. His serum creatinine on arrival was 1.2mg/dl. CT scan abdomen with contrast was done, 48 hours later repeat labs show a serum creatinine of 2.2mg/dl. His pulse is 86 beats per minute and BP is 110/80mmHg. What is the most likely cause of derangement?

Options:
  Acute interstitial nephritis
  Cholesterol emboli
✓ Contrast-induced nephropathy
  Hypovolemia
  Sepsis causing renal impairment

Explanation:
The acute rise in serum creatinine (AKI) occurring within 48 hours following the administration of iodinated contrast media for a CT scan, especially in a diabetic patient, is the classic presentation of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN).

================================================================================
Question 569 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old known diabetic patient comes to the outpatient department with history of sudden onset of swelling at the symphysis for the last 5 weeks. The swelling is tense and non pitting. What is the most appropriate test for checking mean plasma glucose concentration?

Options:
  Fasting blood glucose
  Post prandial blood sugar
  Fructosamine test
✓ HBA1C
  Serum glucose

Explanation:
HbA1c (Glycated hemoglobin) reflects the mean plasma glucose concentration over the previous 8-12 weeks (2-3 months), making it the standard test for assessing long-term glycemic control.

================================================================================
Question 570 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A five year old female patient with a history of recurrent abortions (4/5) and she had 29 years of age. She was diagnosed with Chromosomal Abnormality. Which protein is likely to be found elevated in this patient?

Options:
  Anti-thrombin III
  Albumin
  Protein S
✓ Factor V Leiden mutation
  Factor II prothrombin gene mutation

Explanation:
While the question stem mentions 'diagnosed with Chromosomal Abnormality', it asks about a protein/factor often linked to recurrent abortions in the context of thrombophilia. Factor V Leiden mutation causes resistance to activated protein C, leading to a hypercoagulable state and recurrent pregnancy loss. (Note: Mutation itself is genetic, but leads to abnormal factor V function).

================================================================================
Question 571 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old woman was referred by her gynecologist with symptoms of blood in urine, flank pain, lethargy and weight loss. Renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed on MRI. The cytogenetics studies was performed on a renal tumor which demonstrated the presence of terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Renal cell carcinoma clear cell type
  VHL gene mutation
  Hypoxia inducible factor gene mutation
  Renal cell carcinoma papillary type
  Renal cell carcinoma chromophobe type

Explanation:
Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) is the hallmark genetic abnormality in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 572 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old woman has developed profuse, heavy, erratic and prolonged menstrual bleeding. She is having hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Pelvic ultrasound shows a thickened endometrium. What is the most likely cause of her condition?

Options:
  Endometrial hyperplasia
  Endometrial polyp
  Uterine fibroids
✓ Endometrial carcinoma
  Ovarian Carcinoma

Explanation:
Postmenopausal bleeding, especially with risk factors like obesity, diabetes, hypertension (corpus cancer syndrome), and a thickened endometrium on ultrasound, is highly suspicious for endometrial carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 573 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 years old woman who is a diagnosed case of Diabetes type 2 was diagnosed to have endometrial cancer. What is the most important staging investigation?

Options:
✓ Transvaginal ultrasound
  Chest x-ray
  Hysteroscopy
  Endometrial biopsy
  Pipelle

Explanation:
Endometrial cancer is surgically staged. However, for pre-operative assessment, imaging like MRI or Transvaginal Ultrasound can assess myometrial invasion. Among the options for 'staging investigation' (often implying imaging to assess extent), MRI is best, but TVS is useful. Biopsy confirms diagnosis. Chest x-ray screens for metastasis. Strictly, staging is surgical (FIGO). If forced to choose an imaging modality for local extent, TVS/MRI.

================================================================================
Question 574 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 72 years old female presents to OPD with a diagnosis of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Which of the following medication is most appropriate for this purpose?

Options:
  Cephalexin
  Rifampicin
✓ Letrozole
  Danazol
  Tamoxifen

Explanation:
In postmenopausal women (72 years old) with ER-positive breast cancer, Aromatase Inhibitors like Letrozole are generally preferred over Tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy due to better efficacy.

================================================================================
Question 575 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Urodynamic testing is recommended in all of the following patients except?

Options:
  Pre operative assessment
✓ Stress incontinence
  Failed conservative measures
  All patients in urogynecology
  All patients in oncology

Explanation:
Routine urodynamic testing is NOT recommended for women with clearly demonstrable, uncomplicated stress urinary incontinence before primary surgery. It is reserved for complex cases, failed prior treatments, or mixed symptoms.

================================================================================
Question 576 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old female presents with severe back pain & is suspected for spinal trauma?

Options:
  Immediate medical intervention
  Perform exploratory laprotomy
  Begin dialysis
  Intravenous fluids and blood transfusion
✓ Spinal immobilization

Explanation:
In any patient with suspected spinal trauma, the immediate priority to prevent further neurological injury is spinal immobilization.

================================================================================
Question 577 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Police brought a medico-legal case of an alleged case of concealment of birth. On examination she had enlarged breasts, lax abdominal muscles, and an old healed episiotomy scar. There are reddish-brown vaginal lochia rubra, is present in the vaginal canal. According to examination findings how many days have been passed since she has delivered the baby?

Options:
  1 day
✓ 2-3 days
  4-5 days
  6 days
  1 week

Explanation:
Lochia rubra (red/reddish-brown) typically lasts for the first 3-4 days postpartum. The description fits the early postpartum period (2-3 days).

================================================================================
Question 578 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 14-years-old girl came to ANE. She never had a menstrual period. She experiences severe lower abdominal pain every 28 days. On examination a bluish bulge was seen at introitus. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Asherman's syndrome
✓ Imperforate hymen
  Congenital Adrenal hyperplasia
  Kallman's syndrome
  Transverse vaginal septum

Explanation:
Primary amenorrhea with cyclic abdominal pain (cryptomenorrhea) and a bluish bulge at the introitus (hematocolpos) is the classic presentation of an imperforate hymen.

================================================================================
Question 579 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old P2 has presented with the complaint of menorrhagia for the last 6 months with 3 fibroid in posterior uterine wall. She wants to preserve her fertility. What is the treatment option in her case?

Options:
✓ Myomectomy
  Tranexamic acid and NSAID
  Hysterectomy
  COCP
  Norethisterone

Explanation:
For a symptomatic patient with multiple fibroids who wishes to preserve fertility, myomectomy (surgical removal of fibroids) is the treatment of choice to treat the menorrhagia while sparing the uterus.

================================================================================
Question 580 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old woman is found to have a renal anomaly where one kidney is significantly smaller and non-functioning, while the other kidney is normal in size and function. What is the medical term for this condition?

Options:
✓ Renal hypoplasia
  Horseshoe kidney
  Renal agenesis
  Multicystic dysplastic kidney
  Hepatic cystoma

Explanation:
Renal hypoplasia refers to a kidney that is congenitally small with a reduced number of nephrons but otherwise normal architecture, often leading to poor function.

================================================================================
Question 581 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old male patient was admitted to the chest ward for a very sick patient. He has a history of bladder cancer, hypertension and diabetes. Which of the following factors is the most important predisposing condition for the development of bladder cancer?

Options:
  Aromatic amines
✓ Cigarette smoking
  Cyclophosphamide treatment
  Human papilloma virus
  Chronic cystitis

Explanation:
Cigarette smoking is the single most important risk factor for bladder cancer, accounting for at least 50% of cases.

================================================================================
Question 582 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old woman presented with hard mass in cervix with restricted mobility. Her examination reveals a reddish area of mucosal irregularity over the surface of cervix. The cytogenetics studies was performed on a cervical tumor which demonstrated the presence of terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Common types of cervical carcinoma
  Radiation exposure
  Pollution
✓ Human papilloma virus
  Smoking

Explanation:
The question stem contains conflicting information (chromosome 3p deletion is classic for RCC). However, for a cervical tumor/mass, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the overwhelming primary cause of cervical carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 583 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old female patient has a long history of kidney stones and complains of recurrent abdominal pain. On examination, she has mild abdominal tenderness on the right side. Which investigation would be most reliable for the diagnosis?

Options:
  Abdominal ultrasound
✓ CT scan abdomen
  Sinusitis visne
  Urethral ultrasound
  Retrograde ureteropyelography

Explanation:
Non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis (CT KUB) is the gold standard and most reliable investigation for diagnosing kidney stones.

================================================================================
Question 584 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 years old woman came to a pelvic ultrasound with a mass in the pouch of douglas which contains calcification and septa. Left lateral aspect of the uterus showed a 'ground glass' appearance. She reports severe dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Endometriosis
  Ectopic pregnancy
  Functional ovarian cysts
  Adenomyosis
  Dermoid cyst

Explanation:
The combination of a pelvic mass (likely endometrioma) with 'ground glass' appearance on ultrasound, along with severe dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, is classic for Endometriosis.

================================================================================
Question 585 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient is having a urinary tract infection. Pseudomonas is cultured. Which of the following waste must be collected in black bag?

Options:
✓ Waste collection
  Medical waste
  Catheters
  Body parts
  Urine sample

Explanation:
In hospital waste management color coding, black bags are typically used for non-infectious, general municipal waste (like paper, wrappers). Infectious waste goes in yellow or red. Urine samples or contaminated items would not go in black bags. The question might be asking what *type* of waste goes in black, or is a trick. Assuming standard coding, general waste is black.

================================================================================
Question 586 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
All of the following are treatment options for stress urinary incontinence except?

Options:
  Burch colposuspension
  Transvaginal mesh
  Pelvic floor muscle exercises
✓ Alpha-blocking agents
  Norethisterone

Explanation:
Alpha-blockers relax the urethral sphincter and are used to treat retention/BPH; they can actually *worsen* stress incontinence. They are not a treatment for it. Treatments include pelvic floor exercises, surgery (colposuspension, slings), and sometimes alpha-agonists (not blockers).

================================================================================
Question 587 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old obese woman with type 2 diabetes is found to have inadequate control of her disease 2 months after using metformin alone, metformin and glyburide. The physician decided to add exenatide to her treatment regimen. Which of the following molecular actions most likely mediated the therapeutic effect of the added drug in the patient?

Options:
  Activation of adrenaline
  Activation of glucagon
  Activation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels
✓ Inhibition of glucagon-like polypeptide
  Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase

Explanation:
Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist (incretin mimetic). It works by mimicking the action of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), stimulating insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon. The option D is worded as 'Inhibition of glucagon-like polypeptide' which is incorrect mechanistically (it mimics/activates the receptor), but 'Activation of glucagon-like polypeptide (receptors)' is the intended mechanism. If D implies 'Inhibition of glucagon', that is a correct effect.

================================================================================
Question 588 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2 months old child is brought to pediatric emergency with complaint of urinary obstruction. Ultrasound reveals a large cystic mass in the lower right abdomen which grossly distorted kidney. Biopsy specimen shows ducts and tubules lined by epithelial cells and surrounded by cuffs of cellular mesenchyme. What is the most probable diagnosis on the basis of history and morphology?

Options:
  Carcinoma pelvis
✓ Multicystic dysplasia
  Renal agenesis
  Ectrophy of bladder
  Renal hypoplasia

Explanation:
The findings of a large cystic mass replacing/distorting the kidney in an infant, with histology showing primitive ducts/tubules surrounded by undifferentiated mesenchyme, are characteristic of Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK).

================================================================================
Question 589 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old man was admitted as an inpatient with urosepsis and an acute kidney injury (AKI). Her Potassium level is 6.8 mg/dL. The trainee medical officer on duty asks you to give calcium gluconate to this patient. What's the role of calcium gluconate the management of hyperkalemia?

Options:
  Decrease potassium levels by unknown mechanism
  Increase gastrointestinal loss of potassium
  Increase renal excretion of potassium
  Intracellular shift of potassium
✓ Stabilization of cardiac membrane

Explanation:
Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium levels. Its specific role in severe hyperkalemia is to stabilize the cardiac cell membrane potential, reducing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias.

================================================================================
Question 590 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old woman with history of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease presented to the emergency department with sudden onset right lower quadrant pain with nausea and vomiting. On examination, her abdomen is tender and her heart, pulse and blood pressure shows right sided ovarian mass and fluid collection in Douglas. What is primary treatment for ectopic pregnancy in this patient?

Options:
✓ Surgical removal of ectopic pregnancy
  Bed rest
  Hormonal therapy
  No treatment, it resolves on its own
  Transvaginal ultrasound

Explanation:
Given the acute presentation with pain, fluid in the pouch of Douglas (suggesting rupture/bleeding), and history of PID (risk factor), this is likely a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or one at high risk. Surgical management (salpingectomy or salpingostomy) is the primary treatment for acute/unstable ectopic pregnancy.

Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa) measures the percentage of filtered sodium that is excreted in the urine. It is a useful test to differentiate between prerenal azotemia (low FENa, intact tubular function) and acute tubular necrosis (high FENa, tubular dysfunction).

================================================================================
Question 595 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 years old woman is smoking with increasing frequency, urgency and nocturia despite limiting caffeine intake, bladder re-training and quitting smoking. Which of the following drugs can be used as second line of management?

Options:
  Tolterodine
✓ Solifenacin
  Topical estrogen creams
  Darfenacin
  Trospium

Explanation:
For overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms (frequency, urgency) that fail conservative measures, antimuscarinics like Solifenacin are a standard second-line pharmacological treatment.

================================================================================
Question 596 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28years old female presented with severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She reports missed menstrual period 2 weeks ago. On physical examination, there is tenderness in right iliac fossa. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute appendicitis
  Urinary tract infection
✓ Ectopic pregnancy
  Peritonitis

Explanation:
The triad of missed period, vaginal bleeding, and abdominal pain in a woman of reproductive age is ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. RIF tenderness could be appendicitis, but the missed period/bleeding strongly points to ectopic.

================================================================================
Question 597 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An 18 years old girl presented with a round, painless, and very mobile lump in her right breast that she noticed about a week ago. What would be the radiological investigation of choice?

Options:
✓ Ultrasound
  Mammogram
  CT Scan
  MRI
  Chest X-ray

Explanation:
In women under 35 years of age with a breast lump, breast ultrasound is the radiological investigation of choice because dense breast tissue makes mammography less sensitive.

================================================================================
Question 598 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 year old school teacher, presents with symptoms of leaking urine on coughing, sneezing and while exercising. She is not obese, has no co-morbidities. On examination she has moderate cystocele and minimal rectocele. What is the best first line of treatment for this patient?

Options:
  Vaginal estrogen creams
✓ Supervised pelvic floor exercises
  Anticholinergic medications
  Burch Colposuspension
  Insertion of mid urethral tape

================================================================================
Question 599 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old patient with long standing features of anorexia, nausea, generalized weakness and depressive symptoms. On examination, his blood pressure 180/100. Lab results show Hb 8 gm/dl, SGPT 42, S Creatinine 6 gm/dl (0.5 -1.5 mg/dl), S calcium 12 gm/dl (8.5-10.5 mg/dl), S PTH 400 pg/ml (10-65 pg/ml). What is the most likely cause of hypercalcaemia in this patient?

Options:
  Parathyroid Adenoma
  Parathyroid Carcinoma
✓ Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism
  Renal Cell Carcinoma
  Pagets Disease

Explanation:
The patient has chronic renal failure (Creatinine 6.0). Secondary hyperparathyroidism develops in CRF. When the parathyroid glands become autonomous and secrete high PTH (400) leading to hypercalcemia (Ca 12) despite renal failure, it is called Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism.

================================================================================
Question 600 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old P3 presented with the complaint of gestational amenorrhea and weight loss despite vomiting and vaginal bleeding. Ultrasound examination shows new snow storm appearance, the uterus was 28 weeks. What is the most appropriate treatment modality in this patient?

Options:
  Dilatation and curettage
✓ Suction curettage
  Miniprostal
  Prostaglandin E1
  Norethisterone

Explanation:
The ultrasound finding of 'snow storm appearance' and uterus larger than dates (28 weeks size vs gestational amenorrhea not specified but implied mismatch) indicates a Molar Pregnancy (Hydatidiform Mole). The treatment of choice is Suction Curettage.

================================================================================
Question 601 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A renal biopsy specimen of a 58 year old male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension was send to hospital lab, for a histopathologist. Which while performing gross examination of the renal biopsy, he reported that the capsule was intact and the cortical surface showed areas of hemorrhage.

Options:
  Granulomerulonephritis
✓ Malignant hypertension
  Hyperuricemia
  Amyloidosis
  Perinephric hematoma

Explanation:
Malignant hypertension causes characteristic 'flea-bitten' kidney appearance due to petechial hemorrhages on the cortical surface.

================================================================================

  Imprisonment up to 3 years
  Imprisonment for up to 5 years and removal of name for 2 years only
✓ Imprisonment up to 5 years and removal of name for 3 years
  Removal of name from PMDC

Explanation:
According to the Human Organ Transplant Ordinance (Pakistan), penalties involve imprisonment (up to 10 years in some sections) and fine. Removal of name from the medical register is also a penalty. Option D (Imprisonment up to 10 years and removal of name for 3 years) reflects common legal penalties for such offenses.

================================================================================
Question 604 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38-year-old female presented with symptoms of anovulation and pelvis. She has normal secondary sexual characteristics. What is the first step in the investigation of choice?

Options:
  X-ray abdomen
✓ Serum FSH and LH
  Urine discharge
  CT scan
  All of the above

Explanation:
To investigate anovulation, assessing the hormonal axis is crucial. Serum FSH and LH levels help differentiate between ovarian failure (high FSH/LH) and hypothalamic/pituitary causes (low/normal FSH/LH).

================================================================================
Question 605 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Dispose of hospital waste is done in various form of incinerators. Which of the following waste must be not be incinerated?

Options:
✓ Broken Thermometers
  Catheters

Question 606 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
You are examining a young girl aged 15 years with a history of sexual assault (rape). After all the physical examination, she will need to collect evidence for DNA in order to identify the suspect. There are no examination findings of external trauma or internal trauma. Which of the following samples you will collect?

Options:
  Sheet from the victim to get the DNA of the suspect
✓ Loose hairs, nails scrapings, vaginal swabs, urine, clothes
  Clothes from the crime scene, swabs from the crime scene
  Seminal fluid stains, vaginal swabs, urine, clothes

Explanation:
To collect DNA evidence for identifying the suspect in a sexual assault case, you need biological material that might have been transferred. This includes vaginal swabs (for semen), nail scrapings (for skin/tissue if she scratched him), loose hairs (foreign hair), and her clothes (for stains). Urine is less useful for suspect DNA but for toxicology.

================================================================================
Question 607 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

A women who was pregnant was forced to pay her fee by her in laws as she was divorced with her husband. She lost her pregnancy which was crime according to Pakistan Penal Code. The penalty for this crime is?

Options:
  Punishment for her in law
  Imprisonment up to 5 years
✓ Imprisonment for up to 10 years
  Imprisonment for 1 year
  Imprisonment up to 3 years

Explanation:
Causing miscarriage (Isqat-i-Haml or Isqat-i-Janin) without consent is a serious crime. Depending on the stage of pregnancy (organs formed or not), the punishment can be imprisonment which may extend to 10 years (for Isqat-i-Janin).

================================================================================
Question 608 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 days old male baby was brought to his pediatric OPD with complaints of fever and irritability and dribbling of urine from the baby's umbilicus. On the basis of history and examination, what is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Hydronephrosis
  Vesicoureteric reflex
✓ Patent urachus
  Uriniary extravasation
  Hydrocele

Explanation:
Dribbling of urine from the umbilicus is the pathognomonic sign of a Patent Urachus, a congenital anomaly where the connection between the bladder and the umbilicus fails to close.

================================================================================
Question 609 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old lady presents with milk discharge from her both the nipples. She has also been experiencing headaches and has got secondary infertility. Which of the following blood tests is most likely to help you reach your diagnosis?

Options:
  Cytology of discharge
  C/S of discharge
✓ Serum Prolactin level
  Mammogram
  MRI of the breasts

Explanation:
The triad of galactorrhea (milk discharge), headaches, and infertility/amenorrhea is highly suggestive of a Prolactinoma (pituitary tumor secreting prolactin). Serum Prolactin level is the key diagnostic blood test.

================================================================================
Question 610 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A palpable mass was noted in right lobe of thyroid of a 45 years old man along with enlargement of cervical lymph nodes. Histopathological study revealed tumor cells having ground glass appearance (orphan annie nuclei). What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Anaplastic carcinoma
  Follicular carcinoma
  Medullary carcinoma
✓ Papillary carcinoma
  Thyroid carcinoma

Explanation:
'Orphan Annie' eye nuclei (optically clear nuclei) are the hallmark histopathological feature of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 611 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An acutely ill 30 years old female student of purpuric hemorrhages, fever, hypotension and outspread maculopapular rash. Numerous petechiae and purpuric hemorrhages are scattered over the trunk. Gram stain reveals gram negative meningococci. Serum sodium is markedly decreased while serum potassium is increased. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute renal failure
  Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
✓ Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome
  Meningitis
  Hemophilia

Explanation:
The clinical picture of meningococcemia with shock (hypotension), purpura, and signs of adrenal insufficiency (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) is classic for Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (adrenal hemorrhage associated with severe sepsis).

================================================================================
Question 612 (KMC - 2024)

================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old lady having two kids has planned a small family planning facility. She is having history of High blood pressure and recurrent thromboembolic disease. She wants contraception for 5 years, which of the following contraceptive method will be best suited for her?

Options:
  Barrier methods
  Oral Contraceptives
  Tubal ligation
✓ IUCD
  Injectable contraceptives

Explanation:
For a woman with hypertension and history of thromboembolism, estrogen-containing contraceptives (COCPs) are contraindicated. A copper IUCD (intrauterine contraceptive device) is a safe, long-term (5-10 years), non-hormonal option that avoids these risks.

================================================================================
Question 614 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old male officer gave his blood test to his physician for follow-up. His fasting plasma glucose was found to be 142mg/dl. His previous readings were suggestive of diabetes mellitus. The result of FPG test was 142mg/dl (7.9 mMol/L). Now he wants your opinion regarding the treatment recommendation by international guidelines which of the following is the best suggestion for this patient?

Options:
  Start repeating fasting plasma glucose
  Start repeating A1C
  Start repeating FPG
✓ Start therapy which is confirmed
  Requires urinalysis

Explanation:
A fasting plasma glucose of 142 mg/dL confirms Diabetes Mellitus (cutoff is 126 mg/dL). Since previous readings were also suggestive, the diagnosis is confirmed, and therapy (lifestyle changes +/- metformin) should be started.

================================================================================
Question 615 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following is correct about population and Crude Death Rate?

Options:
  Requires GGIT
  Requires urinalysis
✓ Crude Death Rate of 23/1000 population and Crude Death Rate of 23/1000 population is used to compare death rate of one country with other.
  High stationary
  Early expanding

Explanation:
Crude Death Rate (CDR) is a basic demographic measure used to compare mortality levels between populations, although it is influenced by age structure.

================================================================================
Question 616 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old woman with a history of infertility consulted her fertility specialist for treatment options. The doctor prescribed clomiphene citrate with a short regimen of hormonal support. Which side effect would you expect the doctor to consider in this patient's case?

Options:
  Dysfunctional uterine bleeding
  Ectopic pregnancy
  Infertility
  Menorrhagia
✓ None of the above

Explanation:
Treating a 60-year-old woman for infertility with clomiphene is medically inappropriate and highly unusual as she is post-menopausal. Clomiphene induces ovulation, which is not possible in menopause. Thus, expected side effects of *appropriate* therapy are moot, or 'None of the above' fits the absurdity of the scenario.

================================================================================
Question 617 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A young boy aged 12 years old came to you with complaints of bleeding per rectum. After examination you suspect him as a case of sessil sexualis (sodomy). Which section of Pakistan penal code deals with such a subject?

Options:
  170 ppc
  270 ppc
✓ 377ppc
  279ppc
  374ppc

Explanation:
Section 377 of the Pakistan Penal Code deals with 'Unnatural Offences' (sodomy/carnal intercourse against the order of nature).

================================================================================
Question 618 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old woman presents with a large pelvic-abdominal mass extending to the level of the xiphisternum. It has a heterogeneous appearance with solid and cystic components. The rest of the pelvis and abdomen appears normal and there is no free fluid. The ca 125 level is 430 units. She is asymptomatic. How would you manage this patient? Choose the single best answer.

Options:
  Laparoscopic
✓ Laparotomy and debulking
  Repeat scan and Ca125 in 3 months to check for interval change
  Ovarian cystectomy
  Ultrasound-guided transcutaneous aspiration of ovarian cyst fluid and cytology

Explanation:
A large complex ovarian mass with elevated CA-125 in a postmenopausal woman is highly suspicious for ovarian cancer. The standard of care is staging laparotomy (typically midline incision) and cytoreductive surgery (debulking), including hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

================================================================================
Question 619 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 68 years old male patient came to medical OPD with symptoms of low grade fever with weight loss, abdominal pain and flank pain. There was a palpable mass in the right flank. Ultrasound showed right sided renal mass. Biopsy was taken for histopathology which revealed an epithelial component comprised predominantly of cells with abundant granular cytoplasm and a compact acinar growth pattern. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Conventional (clear cell) carcinoma
  Polycystic kidney
  Medullary sponge kidney
  Sarcoma of the kidney
  Wilms tumor

Explanation:
The clinical presentation (flank mass, pain, weight loss, fever) fits renal cell carcinoma. The histology described 'cells with abundant granular cytoplasm' is less typical for *clear* cell (which has clear cytoplasm) but fits *Chromophobe* or *Oncocytoma*. However, 'Conventional carcinoma' usually refers to Clear Cell RCC. Assuming the description implies RCC features (granular cytoplasm can be seen in high grade or specific subtypes), Conventional RCC is the most common malignancy. If the question implies granular *eosinophilic* cytoplasm, it could be oncocytoma or chromophobe, but those are not options or less likely than the main type. Given options, A is the best fit for a malignant renal mass.

================================================================================
Question 620 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years old women came to OPD with 2 months amenorrhea with slight spotting since 1 day with no abdominal cramps or pain. Her Urine pregnancy test is positive. On bimanual exam uterus is 8 weeks size and on per vaginal examination os is closed. What do you do next to confirm the diagnosis?

Options:
  B HCG
  CBC
  CR P
  Hormonal profile
✓ Transvaginal ultrasound

Explanation:
For early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage) or assessing pregnancy location/viability, Transvaginal Ultrasound is the gold standard investigation to visualize the gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole.

================================================================================
Question 621 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65-year-old patient presents with painless hematuria (blood in urine), fatigue, and unintentional weight loss. Imaging shows a large tumor arising from the renal pelvis. What type of renal tumor is most likely responsible for these symptoms?

Options:
  Renal cell carcinoma
  Wilm's tumor
✓ Transitional cell carcinoma
  Angiomyolipoma
  Oncocytoma

Explanation:
Tumors arising from the *renal pelvis* are most commonly Transitional Cell Carcinomas (Urothelial Carcinomas), which share the same lining as the bladder. Renal cell carcinoma arises from the renal parenchyma.

================================================================================
Question 622 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old female was diagnosed with Pulmonary tuberculosis and started on anti TB drugs. The patient developed yellow discoloration of the sclera 20 days after with a rise of bilirubin of 5 mg/dL and ALT of 500 KU/L. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause?

Options:
  Ethambutol
  Isoniazid
  Rifampicin
  Streptomycin
✓ Pyrazinamide

Explanation:
Pyrazinamide is the most hepatotoxic of the first-line anti-TB drugs. Isoniazid and Rifampicin also cause hepatotoxicity, but Pyrazinamide is notorious for causing dose-dependent liver injury.

================================================================================
Question 623 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old male working in rock crushing industry, for the last 20 years, presented with the complaints of dry cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain. An X-ray advised by doctor showed new snow storm appearance in the lower two third of the lung. Which of the following is the most probable disease?

Options:
  Anthracosis
  Bagassosis
  Byssinosis
✓ Silicosis
  Asbestosis

Explanation:
Rock crushing involves exposure to silica dust. The 'snow storm' appearance on X-ray is a classic description for Silicosis (nodular opacities).

================================================================================
Question 624 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old P2+1 has presented with recurrent episodes of heavy vaginal bleeding 2 months after delivery. Ultrasound examination showed a small cystic mass (3cm) and thickening of uterine wall. On examination she has uterine size 8 weeks. She is having irregular menstrual cycle and her husband's semen analysis is normal. The most likely diagnosis is?

Options:
  Endometrial polyp
✓ Chorion carcinoma
  Incomplete miscarriage
  Endometrial hyperplasia
  Fibroid in uterus

Explanation:
Persistent heavy bleeding after delivery, sub-involution of the uterus (8 weeks size at 2 months postpartum is large), and a uterine mass/thickening should raise suspicion for Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia, specifically Choriocarcinoma, especially with the history of 'P2+1' (implying a previous pregnancy event).

================================================================================
Question 625 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 year old male patient presented with loss of libido. The doctor decided to initiate Bromocriptine treatment in his management. Which of the following best describes its mechanism of action?

Options:
  Inhibit D2 receptors in the hypothalamus
  Block the release of growth hormone through D2 receptors in the posterior pituitary gland
  Block prolactin secretion and indirectly reduce testosterone release
  Suppresses the activity of testosterone-like growth factors (IGFs)
✓ Inhibit prolactin secretion and indirectly reduce testosterone release

Explanation:
Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that stimulates D2 receptors. Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. High prolactin suppresses GnRH, leading to low testosterone and loss of libido. By inhibiting prolactin secretion, Bromocriptine restores the gonadal axis. (Note: Option E says 'reduce testosterone release', but the mechanism actually *restores* it by reducing prolactin. However, it's the best fit for the drug's target).

================================================================================
Question 626 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 27 years old woman and her husband came to the infertility clinic. The woman is having a regular menstrual cycle with no significant medical or surgical history. She has been trying to conceive for 6 months and her husband's semen analysis is also good health. When you asked the patient for how long they have been trying to achieve a pregnancy for almost 6 months... your instructions to the couple would be?

Options:
  To achieve
  They will need IVF to achieve
✓ Continue trying for more 6 months and if no pregnancy is achieved, come back to see you
  Pregnancy
  Consider adoption

Explanation:
Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 1 year of regular unprotected intercourse for women under 35. Since she is 27 and has been trying for only 6 months with no obvious issues, the correct advice is to continue trying for another 6 months.

================================================================================
Question 627 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old woman is diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma after an endometrial biopsy. Staging from MRI shows stage II. Which of the following statements are true?

Options:
  Extension to adjacent organs
  Extension to uterine serosa
  Pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes involved.
✓ Tumor limited to uterine body and cervix
  Tumor limited to uterine body

Explanation:
Stage II Endometrial Carcinoma is defined as tumor invading the cervical stroma, but not extending beyond the uterus.

================================================================================
Question 628 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old multiparous obese woman complains of abnormal vaginal bleeding of 7 months duration. Pelvic examination demonstrates a small anteverted uterus and a normal appearing cervix. No adnexal masses are present. A serum pregnancy test is negative and pap smear is normal. Prolactin and thy stimulating hormone levels are normal. Which of the following is the most efficient next step in management of this patient?

Options:
  Dilatation and curettage
  Pipelle biopsy
  Endometrial cytology
✓ Transvaginal ultrasound
  Hysteroscopy

Explanation:
Transvaginal ultrasound is the most efficient and standard initial investigation for AUB in this age group to assess endometrial thickness. If thickened (>4mm), endometrial biopsy is indicated. However, some guidelines suggest immediate biopsy (Pipelle) for women >45 with AUB. Ultrasound is often the first 'next step' to triage.

================================================================================
Question 629 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
44-year-old woman recently diagnosed with Graves' disease started therapy with methimazole. Inhibition of which of the following enzymes most likely mediates the drug's therapeutic effect in the patient's disease?

Options:
  Thyroid aldolase
  Thyroid mono deiodinase
✓ Thyroid peroxidase
  Thyroid protease
  Topoisomerase

Explanation:
Methimazole (and Propylthiouracil) works by inhibiting Thyroid Peroxidase, the enzyme responsible for the oxidation of iodide and the organification of iodine into tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin.

================================================================================
Question 630 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:

Question 770 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 49 year old perimenopausal woman has had menometrorrhagia for the past 3 months. On physical examination, there are no remarkable findings. The microscopic examination of the endometrial biopsy specimen is shows simple cystic hyperplasia. The patient undergoes dilation and curettage and the bleeding stops with no further problems. Which of the following conditions is most likely to produce these problems?

Options:
  Chronic endometritis
  Ovarian mature cystic teratoma
  Pregnancy with missed abortion
✓ Repeated failure of ovulation
  Use of oral contraceptives

Explanation:
In perimenopausal women, repeated failure of ovulation leads to unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, causing it to thicken excessively. This can result in abnormal uterine bleeding (menometrorrhagia) and endometrial hyperplasia, such as simple cystic hyperplasia.

================================================================================
Question 771 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 23 years old lady presented to you in the gynae clinic with complaints of burning micturation and increased urinary frequency. What is the most common organism causing urinary tract infection?

Options:
  Proteus mirabilus
  Pseudomonas
✓ E.coli
  Klebsiella
  Streptoccocus

Explanation:
*Escherichia coli* (E. coli) is the most common causative organism for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women, accounting for 80-90% of cases.

================================================================================
Question 772 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 29 years old woman who has never been pregnant presents after 2 years of inability to conceive. She has a history of asthma, frequent urinary tract infections and an appendectomy for a ruptured appendix. Her cycles are regular every 30 days. Her husband has two childrens from first wife. What is most likely cause of their infertility?

Options:
  Anovulation
  Endometriosis
✓ Fallopian tubal occlusion
  Fibroid uterus
  Male factor infertility

Explanation:
Given the patient's history of a ruptured appendix, there is a significant risk of pelvic adhesions and subsequent fallopian tubal occlusion, which is a common cause of female infertility. Since her cycles are regular and her husband has children, male factor and anovulation are less likely primary causes.

================================================================================
Question 773 (NWSM - 2023)

Question 774 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 37 yrs old nulligravida presents with her 39 yrsold partner with sub fertality of 7 yrs. during history the femal partenr complains of sever pain during menstural cycles which is not relieved by oral painkilles and she has stated using injectable painkiller, she also complains of heavy flow. she also complains of dysmenorhea.. on examination retroveted uterus with restricted mobility and tender on examination... ultrasound scan shows bilateral adnexal masses with small fundal intramural fibroid... what could be the cause of her subfertality?

Options:
  Adenomyosis
  Fibroid uterus
✓ Endometriosis
  Ovarain masses
  Pelvic Adhesion

Explanation:
The symptoms of severe dysmenorrhea unresponsive to oral painkillers, heavy menstrual flow, dyspareunia (implied by pain during cycles), a retroverted uterus with restricted mobility and tenderness, and bilateral adnexal masses with a 'small fundal intramural fibroid' (which might be incidental or contribute) are highly suggestive of endometriosis, often accompanied by pelvic adhesions. Endometriosis is a common cause of subfertility and pelvic pain.

================================================================================
Question 775 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient is trying to prevent pregnancy by using rhythm method. At which time during woman's cycle is the most fertile?

Options:
  Days 1-5
✓ Days 9-16
  Days 17-21
  Days 22-28
  Days 24-28

Explanation:
The most fertile window in a woman's menstrual cycle is typically around the time of ovulation, which usually occurs between days 9 and 16, encompassing several days before, during, and immediately after egg release.

================================================================================
Question 776 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A P5 patient with 38 years age came to OPD with complaining of heavy menstrual bleeding from last one year, on ultrasound her uterus is normal in size and shape no pathology present, endometrial thickness is 5mm, patient wants treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding also wants contraception. Her last baby born is 2 years. What is the most suitable option for this patient?

Options:
  Cu T intrauterine device
✓ Mirena
  OCPS
  Implant
  Emergency contraceptive pills

Explanation:
For a 38-year-old multiparous woman with heavy menstrual bleeding, a normal uterus, and a desire for both contraception and treatment for heavy bleeding, a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena) is highly suitable. It is highly effective contraception and significantly reduces menstrual blood loss.

================================================================================
Question 777 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A woman 26 years old, para 1, last baby 24 months of age is interested in contraception. She has normal BMI. She want some long acting method of contraception which should not disturb her BMI as she is weight-conscious.

Options:
  Condom
✓ Copper containing IUCD
  Medroxy progesterone injection
  Oral pills
  Emergency contraceptive pill

Explanation:
For a weight-conscious woman seeking long-acting, highly effective contraception that does not affect BMI, a copper-containing IUCD is an excellent choice. It is non-hormonal, thus avoiding potential weight-related side effects associated with some hormonal methods. Medroxyprogesterone injection (DMPA) is known to be associated with weight gain in some users.

================================================================================
Question 778 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is a reversible contraceptive method that involves injecting hormones every three months to prevent pregnancy?

Options:
  Inj Methotraxate 50 mg/ kg m2
  Laproscopic salpingostomy
✓ Laprotomy and salpingectomy
  Laproscopic salpingectomy
  Total abdominal hysterectomy

Explanation:
This patient is hemodynamically unstable (BP 90/60, pulse 100, RR 32) with signs of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy (severe abdominal pain, pv spotting, complex adnexal mass, moderate free fluid). Urgent surgical intervention via laparotomy with salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube) is the most appropriate and life-saving management. Methotrexate is for stable, unruptured ectopics.

================================================================================
Question 780 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The three delays model proposes that pregnancy related mortality is overwhelming due to various reasons of delay in seeking appropriate medical intervention for an obstetric emergency. Which of the following is the most common cause of maternal death in developing nations?

Options:
  Getting adequate nutrition
  Receiving health education
  Getting appropriate transport
  Getting adequate food supplements
✓ Receiving adequate & timely health care at health facility

Explanation:
The 'three delays model' identifies delays in (1) seeking care, (2) reaching a health facility, and (3) receiving adequate and timely care at the health facility as major contributors to maternal mortality. Among these, the delay in receiving adequate and timely care at the health facility is a critical and common factor in developing nations.

================================================================================
Question 781 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by which specific bacterium, known for its spiral shaped appearance under a microscope?

Options:
  Neisseria gonorrhoeae
✓ Treponema pallidum
  Chlamydia trachomatis
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  Streptococcus pyogenes

Explanation:
Syphilis is caused by the bacterium *Treponema pallidum*, which is characterized by its distinctive spiral (spirochete) shape.

================================================================================
Question 782 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 years old patient with body swelling, malar rash, arthralgia, photo-sensitivity and alopecia. She on examination has a malar rash , small joint tenderness and pedal edema. On urine- analysis she has +2 albumin and +3RBC casts. the diagnosis of SLE with renal involvement. Which of the following is not a hallmark of nephritic syndrome?

Options:
  Hematuria
  Hypertension
  Impaired renal functions
✓ Nephrotic-range proteinuria
  Proteinuria

Explanation:
Nephritic syndrome is characterized by hematuria (red blood cell casts), hypertension, and impaired renal function (oliguria). While proteinuria is present, nephrotic-range proteinuria (typically >3.5 g/day) is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome, which is a distinct clinical entity, although some conditions can present with features of both.

================================================================================
Question 783 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A woman 47 years old, para 5, complains of hot flashes. She has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy . She want treatment for this symptoms. The best option for her is?

Options:
  Serotonin
  Solifenacin
  Oxybutynin
  Terbutaline
✓ Tibolone

Explanation:
For a post-oophorectomy woman experiencing hot flashes (menopausal symptoms), Tibolone is a synthetic steroid that offers symptomatic relief by acting as an estrogenic, progestogenic, and weak androgenic agent. Since she has no uterus, progestin protection for the endometrium is not a concern, making systemic estrogen or Tibolone suitable.

================================================================================
Question 784 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A female of 26 years presented to the medical emergency after a miscarriage half an hour ago. She is taken to the labour room. Which of the following will be used for the management of this patient?

Options:
✓ Desogestrel
  Hydroxyprogestrone
  Medroxy progestrone
  Mifepristone
  Norethindrone

Explanation:
This question is problematic. None of the listed options are typically used for the immediate management of a spontaneous miscarriage half an hour ago. Mifepristone is an anti-progestin used to *induce* abortion (often followed by misoprostol), not to manage its immediate aftermath. The other options are progestins primarily used for contraception or to support pregnancy, not for acute miscarriage management. If the miscarriage was incomplete and medical expulsion of retained products was desired, misoprostol (not an option) would be the typical choice.

================================================================================
Question 785 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A female of 55 years was started on a drug to counter act the risk of development of breast carcinoma. The drug made the patient prone to the development of endometrial carcinoma. Which of the following drugs can be given to this patient as a substitute to avoid the risk of endometrial cancer?

Options:
  Estradiol
  Progestin
✓ Raloxifene
  Tamoxifen
  Tibolone

Explanation:
The drug described is likely Tamoxifen, which prevents breast cancer but increases endometrial cancer risk due to its estrogenic effect on the uterus. Raloxifene, another SERM, is a suitable substitute because it has anti-estrogenic effects on the uterus, thus not increasing the risk of endometrial cancer, while still providing bone benefits and breast cancer prevention.

================================================================================
Question 786 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year old man with asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland associated with elevated levels of T3 and T4 is treated with propylthiouracil (PTU). Which of the following best summarizes the principal mechanism of action of PTU?

Options:
  Blocks iodide transport into thyroid
  Increases hepatic metabolic inactivation of circulating T4 and T3
  Inhibits proteolysis of thyroglobulin
✓ Inhibits thyroidal peroxidase
  Releases T3 and T4 into the blood

Explanation:
Propylthiouracil (PTU) primarily inhibits thyroidal peroxidase, an enzyme essential for the organification of iodide and the coupling of iodotyrosines to form T3 and T4. It also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.

================================================================================
Question 787 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 43-year-old man has had watery diarrhea and epigastric pain for the past 3 months. Over-the counter antacid medications do not relieve the pain. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows multiple shallow, sharply demarcated ulcers in the duodenum. He is given omeprazole. Three months later, repeat endoscopy shows that the ulcerations are still present. Which of the following analytes is most likely to be increased in his blood?

Options:
✓ Gastrin
  Glucagon
  Insulin
  Somatostatin
  Vasoactive intestinal peptide

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of severe, refractory peptic ulcers (multiple duodenal ulcers) and watery diarrhea, unresponsive to standard acid suppression, is highly suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma), which is caused by a gastrin-secreting tumor leading to hypergastrinemia.

================================================================================
Question 788 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 24 year old obese woman in her 26th week of pregnancy was diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus after a positive glucose tolerance test. She was otherwise healthy, and her past medical history was unremarkable. Dietary management failed to control the blood glucose, and her physician decided to prescribe anti diabetic therapy. Which of the following drugs would be most appropriate for the patient at this time?

Options:
  Glyburide
✓ Insulin
  Metformin
  Repaglinide
  Sitagliptin

Explanation:
Insulin is considered the gold standard and most appropriate pharmacological treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) when lifestyle modifications fail. It is safe for both the mother and the fetus as it does not cross the placenta.

================================================================================
Question 789 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The estrogen acts through which of the following mechanisms?

Options:
  Activating G protein coupled receptors
✓ Activating hsp90 bound nuclear receptors
  Inactivating the gene transcription
  Inhibition of estrogen response elements
  Inhibition of release of progesterone

Explanation:
Estrogen exerts its biological effects primarily by binding to intracellular estrogen receptors, which are typically found in the cytoplasm bound to heat shock proteins (like hsp90). Upon ligand binding, these receptors translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene transcription.

================================================================================
Question 790 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 66 years old patient with gastro enteritis presents to medical emergency with decreased urine output and AKI, His workup shows hyperkalemia and AKI. ECG shows tall-t waves, which of the following is the immediate treatment of hyperkalemia?

Options:
  insulin with dexrtrose
  Hemodialysis
  Peritoneal dialysis
✓ inj calcium gluconate
  Ventolin nebulizations

Explanation:
In hyperkalemia with ECG changes (such as tall T-waves), intravenous calcium gluconate is the immediate treatment of choice. Its primary role is to stabilize the cardiac membrane and protect the heart from life-threatening arrhythmias, rather than directly lowering potassium levels.

================================================================================
Question 791 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with hypothyroidism following thyroidectomy will require life long hormone replacement therapy. Which of the following agents generally would be most suitable?

Options:
✓ Levothyroxine
  Liothyronine
  Liotrix
  Protirelin
  Thyroid, desiccated

Explanation:
Levothyroxine (synthetic T4) is the most suitable agent for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy after thyroidectomy. It provides a stable and consistent supply of T4, which the body can convert to T3 as needed, maintaining euthyroid status.

================================================================================
Question 792 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 7-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department by his parents because of nausea, vomiting, and persistent abdominal pain secondary to the flu. Medical history of the patient was unremarkable. Pertinent serum values on admission were fasting blood glucose 300 mg/dL (70-110 mg/dL), glycosuria 3+. Which of the following drugs would be appropriate for this patient?

Options:
  Metformin
  Miglitol
  Pioglitazone
✓ Regular insulin
  Repaglinide

Explanation:
The child's symptoms and laboratory findings (high fasting blood glucose, glycosuria) are consistent with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes, often triggered by a viral illness. Insulin therapy, such as regular insulin, is the appropriate and essential treatment for such patients to control hyperglycemia and prevent diabetic ketoacidosis.

================================================================================
Question 793 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old man notes weigh loss, increased appetite and double vision for 6 months. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.7 oc , pulse is 106/ min , respirations are 20/ min, blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. A fine tremor is observed in his outstretched hands .He has bilateral proptosis and corneal ulceration. Laboratory findings include a serum TSH level of 0.1 ml/L. A radio iodine scan indicates increased diffused uptake through out the thyroid. He receives propylthiouracil therapy and his condition improves. Which of the following best describes the microscopic appearance of his thyroid gland before therapy?

Options:
  Destruction of follicles, lymphoid aggregates and hurthle cell metaplasia
  Enlarged thyroid follicles lined by flattened epithelial cells
  Follicular destruction with inflammatory infiltraes containing joint cells
  Nodules with nest of cells separated by healing stroma that stains with congo red
✓ Pappilary projections in thyroid follicles and lymphoid aggregates in stroma

Explanation:
The clinical presentation (weight loss, increased appetite, double vision, tremor, proptosis, low TSH, diffuse increased radioiodine uptake) is classic for Graves' disease (hyperthyroidism). Histologically, Graves' disease is characterized by diffuse follicular hyperplasia, with follicles lined by tall columnar epithelial cells that often form papillary projections into the lumen, and prominent lymphoid aggregates in the stroma.

================================================================================
Question 794 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old male presented with fever, vomiting and decrease urine output. Patient was resuscitated with IV normal saline but his urine output did not improve. The physician suspects acute tubular necrosis and order a urine RE. Which of the following would suggest ATN?

Options:
  Oval fat bodies
  Hexagonal crystals
✓ Muddy casts
  RBC casts
  WBC casts

Explanation:
The presence of 'muddy brown granular casts' in the urine sediment is a classic and highly characteristic finding for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). These casts are composed of necrotic tubular epithelial cells and cellular debris.

Question 795 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Renal colic is a symptom referred to?

Options:
  T6 Dermatome
  T 7 Dermatome
  T8 Dermatome
  T9 Dermatome
✓ T10 Dermatome

Explanation:
Renal colic, caused by kidney stones, typically manifests as severe, intermittent flank pain that often radiates to the groin or inner thigh. This pain pattern corresponds to the T10-L1 dermatomes, with T10 being a common primary reference for kidney pain.

================================================================================
Question 796 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 year old man having history of right loin pain and disuria on and off, was diagnosed with a mass in the right kidney. The most common renal tumor is?

Options:
  Oncocytoma
✓ Renal cell carcinoma
  Angiomyolipoma
  Pheochromocytoma
  Lymphoma

Explanation:
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the kidney in adults. It frequently presents with symptoms like flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable mass, though it can often be asymptomatic until later stages.

On urine- analysis she has +2 albumin and +3RBC casts. the diagnosis of SLE with renal involvement. Which of the following is not a hallmark of nephritic syndrome

Options:
  Hematuria
  Hypertension
  Impaired renal functions
✓ Nephrotic-range proteinuria
  Proteinuria

Explanation:
Nephritic syndrome is characterized by hematuria (often with red blood cell casts), hypertension, and impaired renal function (oliguria). While proteinuria is present, nephrotic-range proteinuria (typically >3.5 g/day) is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome, which is a distinct clinical entity.

================================================================================
Question 798 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old diabetic woman being investigated for recurrent urinary tract infections (Proteus on urine culture & sensitivity) has a staghorn calculus on CT. What is the most likely stone composition?

Options:
  Cysteine
  Calcium oxalate
  Hydrogen
  Uric acid
✓ Struvite

Explanation:
Recurrent urinary tract infections, especially with urease-producing bacteria like *Proteus*, create an alkaline urine environment conducive to the formation of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones. These stones can grow to form large staghorn calculi.

================================================================================
Question 799 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 75-year-old woman being investigated for recurrent urinary tract infections has a stage horn calculus on CT. Urine culture report shows growth of Proteus. What is the most likely stone composition?

Options:
✓ Struvite/ Triple phosphate
  Uric acid
  Calcium Oxalate
  Cysteine

Explanation:
Recurrent urinary tract infections, particularly with *Proteus* species (a urease-producing bacterium), are strongly associated with the formation of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate, also known as triple phosphate) stones, often presenting as staghorn calculi.

================================================================================
Question 800 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6-year-old child has been drinking more water with more frequent urination for the past 7 months. Urinalysis shows pH of 6.5 and no protein, blood, glucose, ketones, WBCs, RBCs, or casts. Serum electrolytes are deranged and creatinine is 3.2 mg/dL. An ultrasound scan shows bilaterally small kidneys with medullary cysts concentrated at the cortico medullary junction. Which of the following gene is most likely mutated in this child?

Options:
  JBTS2
  MCKD1
  NPHP1
  PKD1
✓ PKHD1

Explanation:
The clinical picture of a child with polyuria, polydipsia, small kidneys with medullary cysts at the corticomedullary junction, and progressive renal failure is characteristic of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which is caused by mutations in the *PKHD1* gene.

================================================================================
Question 801 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 13-year-old female collapses while playing basketball. When brought to the emergency room, she is obtunded. She has hypotension, tachycardia, and deep, laboured respirations. She has a serum sodium level of 151 mmol/L, potassium level of 4.6 mmol/L, chloride level of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate level of 7 mmol/L, and glucose level of 521 mg/dL. A Urinalysis reveals no proteins, blood, no nitrate, but there 4+ glucose and 4+ ketone levels. The most probable pathologic finding in pancreas at the time of her collapse is?

Options:
  Amyloid replacement of islets
  Chronic pancreatitis
  Eosinophil infiltration of islets
✓ Loss of islets of Langerhans
  Pancreatic duct obstructions

Explanation:
The patient's presentation (collapse, obtundation, hypotension, tachycardia, deep respirations, hyperglycemia, severe metabolic acidosis with low bicarbonate, hypernatremia, glucosuria, ketonuria) is classic for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), most likely due to new-onset Type 1 diabetes. The underlying pathology in Type 1 diabetes is the autoimmune destruction and subsequent loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans.

================================================================================
Question 802 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5-year-boy develops secondary sex characteristics including pubic hair development and enlargement of the penis. Which of the following morphologic features is most likely to be seen in his adrenal glands?

Options:
  A nodule in the adrenal medulla
  A nodule in the adrenal cortex composed of zona glomerulosa cells
✓ Bilateral adrenal cortical hyperplasia
  Bilateral adrenal cortical atrophy
  Normal size and architecture

Explanation:
Precocious puberty (development of secondary sex characteristics at an early age) in a male child, particularly with pubic hair and penis enlargement, points to an excess of androgens. The most common cause of androgen excess leading to precocious puberty that originates from the adrenal glands is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is characterized morphologically by bilateral adrenal cortical hyperplasia.

================================================================================
Question 803 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 23-year-old woman has a routine health status examination. Her body mass index is 22. Laboratory studies show fasting plasma glucose is 130mg/dL. Urinalysis shows mild glucosuria, but no ketonuria or proteinuria. She has no detectable insulin autoantibodies. Her father was similarly affected at age 20 years. She is most likely to have a mutation in a gene encoding for which of the following?

Options:
  Glucagon
✓ Glucokinase
  GLUT4
  Insulin
  KATP channel proteins (Specific option not fully listed but context implies MODY, often Glucokinase or HNF)

Explanation:
The presentation of mild, early-onset hyperglycemia (fasting glucose 130 mg/dL), glucosuria without ketonuria, absence of autoantibodies, normal BMI, and a strong family history of similar diabetes (father affected at 20) is highly suggestive of Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). MODY type 2, the most common form, is caused by mutations in the glucokinase gene.

================================================================================
Question 804 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A clinical study is conducted in patients diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes Mellitus. Persons with either type develop complications of accelerated and advanced atherosclerosis. All untreated patients have an elevated hemoglobin A1c. Which of the following features common to patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes Mellitus is most likely to be found by this study?

Options:
  Association with certain MHC class II alleles
  High concordance rate in monozygotic twins
  Marked resistance to the action of insulin
✓ Nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins
  Presence of islets cells antibodies

Explanation:
Non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins (formation of advanced glycation end products, AGEs) is a common pathological feature in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. It results from chronic hyperglycemia and contributes significantly to the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications, including accelerated atherosclerosis.

================================================================================
Question 805 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Inhibition of gonadotrophin release is required in a patient for which she is started on gonadotrophin analogues. Which of the following methods of administrations would be followed in this patient?

Options:
  Concomitant use of antagonists
✓ Continuous administration
  Gradual increase in dose
  Pulsatile administration
  Single large dose

Explanation:
Continuous administration of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogues paradoxically leads to desensitization and down-regulation of GnRH receptors in the pituitary, thereby inhibiting gonadotropin release (LH and FSH). This is used to suppress ovarian or testicular function in conditions like endometriosis, prostate cancer, or precocious puberty.

================================================================================
Question 806 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An infant is born with following premature delivery. Multiple external congenital anomalies are noted. The infant exhibits a seizure soon after birth. The blood glucose is 19 mg/dl. Which of the following maternal disease is the most likely cause for the observed findings in this infant?

Options:
  Cystic fibrosis
  Diabetes mellitus, Type II
✓ Gestational diabetes
  Maturity onset diabetes of the young
  Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor

Explanation:
Severe and persistent neonatal hypoglycemia, especially soon after birth, in an infant born prematurely with congenital anomalies, is highly suggestive of uncontrolled maternal gestational diabetes. High maternal glucose levels lead to fetal hyperinsulinemia, which can cause hypoglycemia after birth when the maternal glucose supply is removed. Congenital anomalies can also be associated with poorly controlled maternal diabetes.

================================================================================
Question 807 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A mother brings her 4 month old baby to you. She is concerned that the baby can't hold his neck, is sleepy all the times and has constipation. On examination, the baby is lethargic has a wide open anterior fontanelle, coarse features and a large tongue. Which of the following investigations would you like to do to reach a diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Thyroid function tests
  Liver function tests
  Karyotyping
  Renal function tests
  Ultrasound head

Explanation:
The infant's symptoms (poor head control, sleepiness, constipation, lethargy, wide open anterior fontanelle, coarse features, large tongue) are classic signs of congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism). Thyroid function tests (TSH and free T4) are the key investigations for this diagnosis.

Question 808 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A middle-aged man has experienced diarrhea, nervousness, palpitations and increased irritability for the past 5 months. Proptosis and lid lag are among physical examination findings. Which of the following laboratory findings is the most likely?

Options:
  Increased plasma insulin level
✓ Increased serum T4 level
  Increased serum TSH level
  Increased serum cortisol level
  Increased serum corticotrophin level

Explanation:
The symptoms (diarrhea, nervousness, palpitations, irritability, proptosis, lid lag) are classic for hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease). In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces excessive thyroid hormones, leading to an increased serum T4 level (and often T3), with a suppressed TSH.

================================================================================
Question 809 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a clinical Audit, it has been found that no case of HYPOKALAEMIA has been reported from your lab while the percentage of patients with Hyperkaleimia had been reported from your lab while percentage of patients with Hyperkaleimia, and sodium abnormalities is quite reasonable. All your quality checks are within acceptable range. What could be the cause of this anomaly?

Options:
  A fault in ISE equipment
✓ Delay in separation of serum
  Use of expired reagents
  Use of liquid heparin causing dilution
  Use of collection tubes containing sodium heparin

Explanation:
A common pre-analytical error that can lead to falsely elevated potassium (hyperkalemia) without true clinical hyperkalemia (pseudohyperkalemia) is a delay in the separation of serum from whole blood. As red blood cells and other cells sit in the serum, they can release potassium, artificially increasing the measured level. This would explain why hypokalemia might be missed and hyperkalemia might appear reasonable while actually being artifactual.

================================================================================
Question 810 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year man has experienced severe diarrhea, nervousness, Palpitations and increased irritability for the past 6 months. Proptosis and lid lag are among physical examination findings. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely?

Options:
  Increased plasma insulin level
✓ Increased serum T4 level
  Increased serum TSH level
  Increased serum cortisol level
  Increased serum corticotrophin level

Explanation:
The symptoms (severe diarrhea, nervousness, palpitations, increased irritability, proptosis, and lid lag) are classic for hyperthyroidism, most commonly Graves' disease. These symptoms are due to excessive thyroid hormone production, resulting in elevated serum T4 levels.

================================================================================
Question 811 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16 years old male patient with history of sudden onset bilateral lower limb weakness, power of 0/5, he reports celebrating his birthday last night and reports intake of 5 slices of cake. His ECG shows prolonged QT interval with u-wave. Which of the following is responsible?

Options:
  Sodium
  Magnesium
  Phosphorus
  Calcium
✓ Potassium

Explanation:
The sudden onset of bilateral lower limb weakness, particularly severe (power 0/5), along with ECG findings of a prolonged QT interval and U-waves, are classic signs of severe hypokalemia. This can be precipitated by carbohydrate-rich meals (like cake) in susceptible individuals, as insulin release drives potassium intracellularly.

================================================================================
Question 812 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
76 years old female, known case of small cell carcinoma lung under treatment from oncologist presented to E.R with fits, he denies extra medications and other symptoms emergency investigation are ordered, serum sodium is 101, other labs are normal. What is most probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ SIADH
  Psychogenic polydypsia
  thiazide induced Hyponatremia
  hypovolemic Hyponatremia
  hypervolemic Hyponatremia

Explanation:
A patient with small cell carcinoma of the lung presenting with severe hyponatremia (serum sodium 101 mEq/L) and seizures, in the absence of other obvious causes, strongly suggests the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) secretion. Small cell lung cancer is a well-known paraneoplastic cause of SIADH.

================================================================================
Question 813 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A female of 35 years was receiving Somatotrophin for adiposity, asthenia and reduced muscle mass. A few weeks later she presented to the medical emergency anxiety and ovarian dysfunction. On examination, her prolactin levels were low. Which of the following drugs is most likely responsible for the patient's condition?

Options:
  Bromocriptine
  Mecasermin
  Prolactin
  Somatostatin
✓ Somatotrophin

Explanation:
Somatotropin (Growth Hormone, GH) can have various side effects. High doses or prolonged use can lead to anxiety and can also cause ovarian dysfunction, potentially through its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis or direct effects on the ovary. The mention of low prolactin levels is a distractor, as this would typically be caused by dopamine agonists like bromocriptine, which is not the primary drug mentioned here.

================================================================================
Question 814 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years old female is having polyuria (3.5 litres of urine /day). She is not a known patient of diabetes mellitus. She has been referred to you for carrying out 'water deprivation test' to rule out diabetes insipidus. Which of the following is the most important parameter to be tested in blood and urine?

Options:
  Estimation of Aldosterone
  Estimation of BNP
  Renal function tests
  Serum and urine electrolytes
✓ Serum and urine osmolality

Explanation:
In a water deprivation test to diagnose diabetes insipidus, the most crucial parameters to monitor are serum and urine osmolality, along with urine volume. These measurements help assess the kidney's ability to concentrate urine in response to dehydration and to exogenous ADH (if administered later in the test).

================================================================================
Question 815 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
(Duplicate of 12) A 25 years old female is having polyuria. She is not a known patient of diabetes mellitus. She has been referred to you for carrying out 'water deprivation test' to rule out diabetes insipidus. Which of the following is the most important to be tested in blood and urine?

Options:
  Estimation of Aldosterone
  Estimation of BNP
  Renal function tests
✓ Serum and urine electrolytes
  Serum and urine osmolality

Explanation:
In a water deprivation test for diabetes insipidus, the most important parameters to measure are serum and urine osmolality. This directly assesses the body's ability to concentrate urine and distinguishes between central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Serum and urine electrolytes are also important, but osmolality is key.

================================================================================
Question 816 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 56 year old lady presented to the medical unit complaining of excessive tiredness, cold intolerance, constipation and dry skin. She is Post menopausal and is having these symptoms for about 3 months. She has also gained some weight. Which among the following is the probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Hypothyroidism
  Acromegaly
  Metabolic Syndrome
  Cushing's Disease
  Adrenal Insufficiency

Explanation:
The symptoms of excessive tiredness, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, and weight gain, especially in a postmenopausal woman, are classic manifestations of hypothyroidism.

================================================================================
Question 817 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 36 years old with history of head trauma secondary to road traffic accident presents to ER with polydipsia, polyuria. He denies extra medications and other comorbids. His workup shows sodium of 174, and normal osmolality. Whats the probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Central diabetes insipidus
  Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  Partial diabetes insipidus
  Psychogenic polydipsia
  SIADH

Explanation:
The history of head trauma, severe polydipsia and polyuria, hypernatremia (sodium 174 mEq/L), and *normal* (meaning inappropriately dilute for the hypernatremia) urine osmolality are classic for central diabetes insipidus. Head trauma can cause damage to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary, impairing ADH production.

================================================================================
Question 818 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year female subjected to renal transplantation 2 years ago. After the surgery she started steroid therapy to prevent the rejection of transplantation. She came to the hospital for screening and the adrenal biopsy was done. What's the most likely finding that can be observed?

Options:
✓ Cortical atrophy
  Cortical hypertrophy
  Diffuse hyperplasia
  Dysplasia
  Macro nodular hyperplasia

Explanation:
Long-term exogenous steroid therapy, such as for preventing transplant rejection, suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This leads to decreased ACTH secretion, resulting in bilateral adrenal cortical atrophy due to lack of stimulation.

================================================================================
Question 819 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old, previously healthy man comes to his physician for a routine health examination. On palpation, his prostate is normal in size. Laboratory study shows a serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of 17 ng/mL, however twice the value he had 1 year ago. A urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following histologic findings in a subsequent biopsy specimen of the prostate is most likely to account for the patient's current status?

Options:
  Nodular hyperplasia
✓ Adenocarcinoma
  Acute prostatitis
  Chronic abacterial prostatitis
  Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia

Explanation:
A significantly elevated and rapidly rising PSA level (17 ng/mL, double in a year), even with a normal-sized prostate on palpation, is highly suspicious for prostate adenocarcinoma, especially in a 70-year-old man. A biopsy would most likely reveal prostate cancer.

================================================================================
Question 820 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 3 months old infant presented with right side empty scrotum. On examination; right testis is palpable in right Inguinal region; A diagnosis of right undescended testicle(UDT) is made . What is the ideal age of Orchidopexy?

Options:
✓ 6-9 months
  1-2 years
  2-5 years
  After 5 years

Explanation:
Orchidopexy, the surgical correction for undescended testicles, is ideally performed between 6 and 18 months of age (or within 6-9 months of diagnosis if diagnosed later in infancy). Early intervention is crucial to optimize testicular development and reduce the risk of long-term complications.

================================================================================
Question 821 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38-year- old man previously in good health suddenly develops severe abdominal pain radiating from the left loin to the groin and associated with nausea and perspiration and frequent urination. He is restless, tossing and turning in bed but has no other abnormal findings. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Herpes zoster involving the left lower rib dermatome
✓ Left ureteric calculus
  Retroperitoneal hemorrhage
  Sigmoid diverticulitis
  Torsion of the left testicle

Explanation:
Severe abdominal pain radiating from the loin (flank) to the groin, associated with nausea, perspiration, and frequent urination, with the patient being restless and unable to find a comfortable position, is the classic presentation of renal colic caused by a ureteric calculus (kidney stone).

================================================================================
Question 822 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The result that most accurately reflects severe renal disease is?

Options:
✓ S.creatinine=4.7mg /dl. Creatinine Clearance= 46 ml/min , BUN = 85 mg/dl
  S.creatinine= 1.0mg/dl. Creatinine Clearance=112ml/min, BUN =18 mg/dl
  S.creatinine= 2.5mg/dl.Creatinine Clearance= 119 ml/min, BUN=16mg/dl
  S.creatinine=1.1mg/dl.Creatinine Clearance=96ml/min, BUN=45mg/dl
  S.creatinine=1.2mg/dl.Creatinine Clearance=106ml/min, BUN=22mg/dl

Explanation:
Severe renal disease is characterized by significantly elevated serum creatinine and BUN, and a markedly reduced creatinine clearance (which estimates GFR). Option (a) shows very high serum creatinine (4.7 mg/dL) and BUN (85 mg/dL) with a significantly low creatinine clearance (46 ml/min), indicating severe impairment of renal function.

================================================================================
Question 823 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 14- years old female presented with body swelling, hematuria and decreased urinary output. She reports sore throats 12 days back. on examination, she has congested throat, pedal edema, on further examination she has +2 albumin and + 3 RBC. The physician suspects nephritic syndrome, which of the following pathology is the possible diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Post infection GN
  IgA nephropathy
  Alports syndrome
  Acute interstitial
  ATN

Explanation:
The clinical picture of body swelling, hematuria, decreased urinary output (oliguria), sore throat 12 days prior, pedal edema, proteinuria, and red blood cells in urine, leading to suspicion of nephritic syndrome, is classic for acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis, typically post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

================================================================================
Question 824 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28-year-old woman has had difficulty concentrating at work or the past month. She is constantly getting up and walking around to visit co-workers. She complains that the work area is too hot. She seems nervous and often spills her coffee. She has been eating more but has lost 5kg in the past 2 months. On physical examination her temperature is 37.5 C, pulse 101/minute,respiratory rate 22/minute, and blood pressure 145/85 mm Hg. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be present in this woman?

Options:
  Decreased catecholamines
  Decreased iodine uptake
  Decreased plasma insulin
✓ Decreased TSH
  Increased ACTH

Explanation:
The symptoms (difficulty concentrating, restlessness, heat intolerance, nervousness, weight loss despite increased appetite, tachycardia, hypertension) are highly suggestive of hyperthyroidism. In primary hyperthyroidism, the excessive production of thyroid hormones suppresses TSH secretion from the pituitary, leading to a decreased TSH level.

================================================================================
Question 825 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old man has dysuria, increased frequency, and urgency of urination for the past 6 months. He has sometimes experienced mild lower back pain . On physical examination, he is afebrile. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness. The prostate gland feels normal in size; no nodules are palpable. Laboratory studies show that expressed prostatic secretions contain 30 leukocytes per high- power field. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  Acute bacterial prostatitis
  Syphilitic prostatitis
✓ Chronic abacterial prostatitis
  Metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma

Explanation:
The symptoms of dysuria, frequency, urgency, and lower back pain, along with the presence of leukocytes in expressed prostatic secretions (indicating inflammation) but without fever or a palpable prostate abnormality, are characteristic of chronic abacterial prostatitis (also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome or chronic nonbacterial prostatitis).

================================================================================
Question 826 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The softening of lower segment of uterus refers

Options:
  Braxton-Hick's sign
  Chadwick sign
  Goodell's sign
✓ Hegar's sign
  Uterine souffle

Explanation:
Hegar's sign is the softening of the lower uterine segment (isthmus) that is palpable during a bimanual examination, typically occurring around 6-8 weeks of pregnancy.

================================================================================
Question 827 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Optimum number of visits is recommended antenatal clinic if everything is normal. However, if it is difficult for pregnant women to attend antenatal clinic regularly , the minimum number of visits target covering the entire period of pregnancy should be?

Options:
  3 visits
✓ 4 visits
  2 visits
  6 visits
  5 visits

Explanation:
While the World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends a minimum of eight antenatal care contacts, historically and in some contexts where access is limited, a minimum of four antenatal visits was recommended for uncomplicated pregnancies to ensure essential care.

================================================================================
Question 828 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
According to the Hess's rule, when fetal length is 40 cm , the age of fetus will be?

Options:
  4 months
  5 months
  6 months
  7 months
✓ 8 months

Explanation:
Hess's rule (or Haase's Rule) provides an estimation of fetal age based on length. For fetal lengths over 25 cm, the age in months is approximated by dividing the length in centimeters by 5. So, 40 cm / 5 = 8 months.

================================================================================
Question 829 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Injecting soapy solution into the uterus during criminal abortion is likely to result in?

Options:
✓ Air embolism
  Fat embolism
  Hemorrhage
  Perforation of uterus
  Thromboembolism

Explanation:
Injecting soapy solutions (or other liquids) into the uterus during illegal abortions can introduce air into the maternal circulation, leading to a life-threatening air embolism.

================================================================================
Question 830 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Goodell's sign of pregnancy means:

Options:
  Blowing murmur is heard on the side of uterus
  Enlargement of breast
✓ Softening of cervix of uterus
  Softening of lower uterine segment
  Vaginal mucosa is bluish in color

Explanation:
Goodell's sign is the softening of the cervix of the uterus, typically observed around the sixth week of pregnancy, due to increased vascularity and edema. This is a probable sign of pregnancy.

================================================================================
Question 831 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
'Atavism' means:

Options:
  Child resembles his both parents
  Child resembles his brother
  Child resembles his father
✓ Child resembles his grand parents
  Child resembles his mother

Explanation:
Atavism refers to the reappearance of an ancestral trait that has been absent in intervening generations, meaning a child might resemble a grandparent or even more distant ancestor, rather than immediate parents or siblings.

================================================================================
Question 832 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55- year- old male patient with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents to a primary health clinic with complaints of anuria ( complete absence of urine output) and severe fatigue. He reports a gradual decrease in urine output over the past 24 hours. On examination, you note bilateral lower limb swelling and elevated blood pressure. Which of the following actions is most appropriate?

Options:
  Initiate treatment for urinary track infection
✓ Urgently refer the patient to a nephrologist
  Start the patient on over-the-counter diuretics
  Order a renal ultrasound for outpatient evaluation
  Schedule a follow up appointment for a comprehensive assessment

Explanation:
Anuria (complete absence of urine output) in a patient with hypertension and diabetes is a medical emergency indicating acute kidney injury or severe urinary obstruction. Urgent referral to a nephrologist is critical for immediate evaluation, diagnosis, and management, which may include emergent dialysis.

================================================================================
Question 833 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The treatment of choice for a large renal pelvic stone is?

Options:
  ESWL
✓ Per cutaneous nephrolithotomy
  Open surgery
  Ureteroscopy
  None of the above

Explanation:
For large renal pelvic stones (typically >2 cm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is considered the treatment of choice due to its high stone-free rates and ability to manage larger stone burdens more effectively than ESWL or Ureteroscopy.

================================================================================
Question 834 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10-year-old woman has had a fever and chills accompanied by right flank pain for the past 3 days. She has had two similar episodes during the past year. On physical examination, her temperature is 38.3 C , her blood pressure is 152/ 92 mmHg, and there is right costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory findings show a serum glucose level of 77 mg/dL and creatinine level of 1 mg/dL. Urinalysis shows a PH of 6.5 ; specific gravity, 1.018; and no protein, glucose , blood or ketones. Microscopic examination of the urine shows man WBCs and WBCs casts. Which of the following is the most useful test to obtain on this patient?

Options:
  Anti nuclear antibody
  Abdominal CT scan
  Plasma renin
  Renal biopsy
✓ Urine culture

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (fever, chills, right flank pain, CVA tenderness) and urinalysis findings (WBCs and WBC casts) are classic for pyelonephritis (upper urinary tract infection). Given her recurrent episodes, a urine culture is the most useful test to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

================================================================================
Question 835 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old man having history of right loin pain and disuria on and off, was diagnosed with a mass in the right kidney. on tissue biopsy, it was found hypernephroma of right kidney . What should be the management plan?

Options:
✓ Rt radical nephrectomy
  Partial nephrectomy
  Adjuvant chemotherapy
  Follow up and chemotherapy
  Monoclonal antibodies

Explanation:
Hypernephroma is an older term for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). For a diagnosed renal mass (tumor) consistent with RCC, radical nephrectomy (removal of the entire kidney and surrounding structures) is the standard curative management, especially if the tumor is localized and can be completely resected.

================================================================================
Question 836 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 year old pregnant woman with no comorbids presents to clinic for her regular prenatal visit. She is 34 weeks pregnant and doesn't have any symptoms. Examination is normal. Routine labs are normal except for urine RE that shows +albumin, 4 5 RBCs and numerous pus cells. What is the next best step in management?

Options:
  Repeat urine RE in 1 week
✓ Give antibiotics
  Send blood cultures
  24 hour urine collection for protein
  Serum albumin level

Explanation:
The presence of +albumin, RBCs, and numerous pus cells in the urine of a pregnant woman, even if asymptomatic, is highly suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), possibly asymptomatic bacteriuria, which carries risks in pregnancy. Prompt treatment with antibiotics is necessary to prevent progression to pyelonephritis or other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

================================================================================
Question 837 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 3 year old boy come with periorbital puffiness and pedal edema. Mom says she has been noticing this puffiness for 3 to 4 days. She also says is fatigued and has not gone school for last 3 days. You order some labs. What would be the most diagnostic test for nephrotic syndrome?

Options:
✓ 24 hr urine protein and creat clearance
  Urean protein creat ratio more than 2
  Urine protein creat ratio more than 5 (Often used >3 or >2 for nephrotic)
  Low albumin and hypercholesterolemia
  Urine protein more than 3+ on urine R/E

Explanation:
The symptoms (periorbital puffiness, pedal edema, fatigue) are classic for nephrotic syndrome in a child. The most diagnostic test to confirm nephrotic syndrome is a 24-hour urine collection for protein, which quantifies the amount of protein loss (defined as >3.5 g/24 hours in adults or >40 mg/m2/hour in children). Creatinine clearance would also be assessed as part of renal function.

================================================================================
Question 838 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 47-year-old man presented with flank pains that occur on either side for months. He was known hypertensive and on antihypertensive medicines for years. His urine analysis showed red cells in urine. On physical examination, he had a mass deep in each flank. His laboratory test showed raised BUN that was 48 mg/dL (normal is 20 mg/dL) and creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count was normal. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute pyelonephritis
  Acute glomerulonephritis
  Chronic renal failure
✓ Polycystic kidney disease
  Renal cell carcinoma

Explanation:
The patient's long-standing hypertension, bilateral flank pain, red cells in urine (hematuria), palpable masses in each flank, and elevated BUN/creatinine (indicating renal impairment) are classic features of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This genetic disorder causes numerous cysts to develop in the kidneys, leading to enlargement, pain, hypertension, and progressive renal failure.

================================================================================
Question 839 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 68 year old lady with uncontrolled diabetes presents to ER with altered mental status and high grade fever associated with rigors and chills for the past 3 days. She also complains of left sided flank pain and burning micturation. On examination pulse is 110/m, BP 90/60 mmHg, temperature 103'F, oxygen saturation 97% and respiratory rate of 22/m. Her GCS is 13/15, chest is clear to auscultation and her left flank is tender on deep palpation. Investigations show Hb 12 mg/dl, TLC 25, platelets 155, Urea 50, creatinine 1.2 and urine R/E +++ albumin, 10 RBC and 10 15 pus cells. You have sent her blood for culture. What investigation will you do for diagnosis?

Options:
✓ CT abdomen
  CT brain
  Lumber puncture
  Echo
  Arterial blood gases

Explanation:
The patient's presentation (uncontrolled diabetes, fever, rigors, chills, altered mental status, flank pain, burning micturition, hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and pyuria/hematuria) is highly suggestive of severe pyelonephritis, possibly complicated by sepsis. A CT abdomen is crucial for diagnosing the extent of the infection, ruling out abscess formation, or identifying obstructive uropathy, which is critical in an immunocompromised patient like a diabetic.

================================================================================
Question 840 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16 years old, male patient presented with periorbital puffiness, pedal edema and generalized body swelling. On examination he was found out to have marked edema and pleural effusion. His urine analysis showed ++++ albumin. What does it specify?

Options:
  Acute interstitial nephritis
  Nephritic syndrome
✓ Nephrotic syndrome
  Acute tubular necrosis
  Acute kidney injury

Explanation:
The presence of generalized body swelling, periorbital puffiness, pedal edema, pleural effusion, and massive proteinuria (++++ albumin on urine analysis) are the classic hallmarks of nephrotic syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 841 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old male presents to ER with 5 days history of severe diarrhea and vomiting. He has had multiple episodes of watery diarrhea since this morning. He hasn't passed any urine since morning. On examination his pulse is 120/m, BP is 110/80 mmHg, temperature is 100'F, respiratory rate is 20/m and pulse oximetry is normal. He is drowsy with no focal signs. On auscultation there are normal breath sounds over chest but cardiac auscultation reveals pericardial rub sound. Abdomen is scaphoid with tenderness and normal bowel sounds. Investigations show a normal CBC, urea 240, creatinine 8, GFR 15, potassium 7, HCO3 8 and severe metabolic acidosis on ABGs. ECG shows tall tented T waves and Echo shows a thin rim of pericardial effusion. You pass a large bore IV cannula, start administering fluid boluses and give potassium lowering therapy. What is the next step in management of this patient?

Options:
  Oral vancomycin
  Order CT abdomen and pelvis
✓ Arrange dialysis
  Lumber puncture
  Pericardiocentesis

Explanation:
This patient has acute kidney injury (creatinine 8, GFR 15) with severe hyperkalemia (K 7, tall T-waves on ECG) and uremic pericarditis (pericardial rub, effusion). Given the refractory hyperkalemia and uremic symptoms, emergency dialysis is the definitive next step in management to correct the electrolyte abnormalities and manage kidney failure.

================================================================================
Question 842 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6 year old child presents to you with 10 days history of generalized body swelling which first started around the eyes then spread to the rest of the body. On examination the child is vitally stable, generalized body oedema present, no jaundice, no visceromegaly, CVS S1, S2, 0. Investigations show 4+ proteins, RBCs nil on Urine RE, serum Albumin 2g/dl, serum Cholesterol 300mg/dl, Liver function tests are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Congestive Cardiac Failure
✓ Nephrotic Syndrome
  Acute Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis
  Protein Losing Enteropathy
  Chronic Liver Disease

Explanation:
The clinical picture of generalized body swelling (edema starting periorbitally), massive proteinuria (4+ proteins in urine), low serum albumin (hypoalbuminemia), and high serum cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) is the classic diagnostic tetrad for nephrotic syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 843 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old male patient under treatment from a hematologist for lymphoma, presented to medical OPD with complaints of anasarca, pedal edema and body swelling. He reports shortness of breath and abdominal pain. On examination, there is pedal edema and bilateral pleural effusion. The physician orders urine analysis which shows +4 proteinuria and suspects Nephrotic syndrome. Which of the following is gold-standard of diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome?

Options:
  urine analysis
  urine PCR
  renal biopsy
  ultrasound KUB
✓ 24 hours urinary protein

Explanation:
While urine analysis can indicate proteinuria, the gold standard for diagnosing and quantifying nephrotic syndrome is a 24-hour urinary protein collection, which confirms the excretion of >3.5 grams of protein per day. Renal biopsy provides the histological diagnosis of the underlying cause but is not the initial gold standard for the syndrome itself.

================================================================================
Question 844 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 75 year old gentleman was referred to neurology clinic yesterday for morning slow movements and resting tremors. Based on history and examination he was diagnosed as Parkinson's disease and started on levodopa and amantadine. His symptoms improved but he developed hypogastric pain later in evening that has progressively increased and he has come to ER now. He hasn't passed any urine since yesterday. On examination pulse is 100/m, BP 150/80 mmHg, afebrile and normal respiratory rate and pulse oxygen saturations. A tender mass can be felt in hypogastrium upto umblicus. Labs show normal CBC, Urea 150, creatinine potassium 5 and sodium 145. What is the next best step in management?

Options:
  CT abdomen
  Dialysis
  Give opioids for pain
✓ Pass folley's catheter
  Surgical review

Explanation:
The patient's inability to pass urine since yesterday, progressively increasing hypogastric pain, and a tender mass in the hypogastrium indicate acute urinary retention. The immediate and best step in management is to pass a Foley's catheter to decompress the bladder and relieve the obstruction.

Question 845 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old lady presents with history of recurrent UTIs. She wishes to receive medicine to prevent further recurrent of UTIs. She is started on a drug that is acts by splitting formaldehyde and ammonia in the acidic urine. Which of the following drugs was most likely to given to this patient?

Options:
✓ Methenamine mandelate
  Nalidixic acid
  Nitrofurantoin
  Oxalinic acid
  Phenazopyridine

Explanation:
Methenamine mandelate is a urinary antiseptic that is hydrolyzed in acidic urine to formaldehyde and ammonia. Formaldehyde then acts as a non-specific antiseptic, helping to prevent recurrent UTIs. This mechanism is unique among the options provided.

Question 846 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient suffering from urinary tract infection was started on a drug that didn't achieve any significant systemic levels but accumulated in the urinary bladder and eradicated the local infection. Which of the following is the most probable drug that fits the above mentioned profile?

Options:
  Amoxicillin
  Cotrimoxazole
  Levofloxacin
✓ Nitrofurantoin
  Trimethoprim

Explanation:
Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic commonly used for urinary tract infections. It is rapidly cleared by the kidneys, achieving high concentrations in the urine while maintaining low systemic levels. This characteristic makes it effective for localized bladder infections without significant systemic exposure.

Question 848 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with a previously undiagnosed thyroid cancer presents with thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm). One drug that is administered as part of early management, and may be lifesaving, is propranolol. Which of the following best summarizes why we give this drug, or what we want it to do?

Options:
  Block parenchymal cell receptors for thyroid hormones
  Block thyroid hormone release by a direct effect on the gland
  Inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis
✓ Lessen dangerous cardiovascular signs and symptoms of thyroid hormone excess
  Lower TSH levels

Explanation:
Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used in thyroid storm primarily to control the life-threatening cardiovascular manifestations (tachycardia, arrhythmias) caused by the increased adrenergic tone. While it also blocks the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, its immediate lifesaving role is cardiovascular stabilization.

Question 851 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38 years old lady married for 5 years visit to opd for conception past significant medical and surgical history,non smoker,female partner FSH 6.5 ,LH 5,scan shows dominant follicle in right ovary ,normal left ovary .MaIe partner sperm count 2 million /ml,motility 10 percent with low progression , morphology 85 percent abnormality.what method of treatment will you prescribe ?

Options:
✓ Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection
  Ovulation induction
  Wait and see
  IUI / Injectables

Explanation:
The male partner has severe oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OATS) with a very low sperm count (2 million/ml). For severe male factor infertility, Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is the treatment of choice, as natural conception or IUI has a very low success rate.

================================================================================
Question 852 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A woman 32 years old presented to gynaecologist for infrequent cycles since menarche.She is married since 3 months and want conception.Her BMI is 29.Her husband will be leaving in 2 months for abroad and she want to conceive. The best option for her is

Options:
  folic acid
  injectable ovulatory drugs
✓ oral ovulatory drugs
  Progesterone

Explanation:
The patient has infrequent cycles (likely anovulation) and a very short timeframe to conceive. Ovulation induction is required. Oral ovulatory drugs (like Clomiphene Citrate or Letrozole) are the standard first-line treatment for WHO Type 2 anovulation (often PCOS-related) to induce ovulation promptly.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Question:
A 62 year old male presents with urinary retention and perirectal pain. He has had recent low grade fever ,urinary urgency, and increasing difficulty voiding until he was unable to void at all this morning. Digital rectal exam reveals a swollen,boggy prostate that is tender on examination. what is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH)
  Urinary tract infection
✓ Bacterial prostatitis
  Prostatic abscess
  Acute renal injury

Explanation:
The clinical triad of fever, pelvic/perineal pain, and urinary retention, combined with the finding of a tender, boggy prostate on DRE, is classic for Acute Bacterial Prostatitis. BPH is typically non-tender.

================================================================================
Question 854 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22-year-old woman with type-I diabetes was brought unconscious to the emergency department. Her blood glucose level was 395 mg/dL(normal 70-110 mg/dL). An intravenous infusion of insulin was started, and 6 hours later the patient's blood glucose decreased to a normal level. Which of the following molecular actions most likely contributed to the therapeutic effect of the drug in the patient's disorder?

Options:
  Activation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -sensitive K+ channels in target cells
  Inhibition of glucose transporters in pancreas cell membranes
  Inhibition of liver glucokinase
✓ Phosphorylation of a tyrosine kinase-linked receptor
  Stimulation of hormone-sensitive lipase

Explanation:
Insulin acts by binding to the insulin receptor, which is a tyrosine kinase receptor. Upon binding, the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation, initiating a signaling cascade (PI3K/Akt pathway) that leads to the translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane in muscle and adipose tissue, promoting glucose uptake.

Options:
✓ Amoxicillin
  Aztreonam
  Benzyl Penicillin
  Ciprofloxacin
  Doxycycline

Explanation:
Amoxicillin (and other beta-lactams like cephalosporins) are considered safe for treating UTIs in pregnancy. Doxycycline (tetracycline) is contraindicated due to effects on fetal bone/teeth. Ciprofloxacin (fluoroquinolone) is generally avoided due to potential cartilage toxicity.

================================================================================
Question 859 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#13 The three delays model proposes that pregnancy related mortality is overwhelming due to various reasons of delay in seeking appropriate medical intervention for an obstetric emergency. Which of the following is the most common cause of maternal death in developing nations

Options:
  Getting adequate nutrition
  Receiving health education
  Getting appropriate transport
  Getting adequate food supplements
✓ Receiving adequate & timely health care at health facility

Explanation:
Based on the Three Delays Model, Delay 3 (receiving adequate and appropriate care once at the facility) is a critical determinant of survival, alongside delays in seeking care and transport. The option effectively describes the failure of the health system to provide timely care.

Question:
Q#15 . A 75-year-old woman being investigated for recurrent urinary tract infections has a stag horn calculus on CT. Urine culture report shows growth of Proteus. What is the most likely stone composition?

Options:
✓ Struvite/Triple phosphate
  Uric acid
  Calcium Oxalate
  Cystiene
  None of the above

Explanation:
Proteus species are urease-producing bacteria. Urease splits urea into ammonia, alkalinizing the urine and precipitating magnesium ammonium phosphate (Struvite) stones, which often form staghorn calculi.

================================================================================
Question 862 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A woman 62 years old presented to gynae Outpatient department with the complaint of post menopausal spotting.She has BMI of 37 and has only two daughters.Her ultrasound report shows endometrial thickness of 8 mm.Uterus is bulky and adenexa is normal.The next step to confirm her diagnosis is

Options:
  CT abdomen
  dil station and curretage
  hysteriosalpingogram
✓ Hysteroscopic biopsy
  MRI pelvis

Explanation:
In a postmenopausal woman with bleeding and thickened endometrium (>4mm), malignancy must be ruled out. Hysteroscopic guided biopsy is the gold standard as it allows visualization of the cavity and targeted biopsy of the lesion, offering higher sensitivity than blind D&C.

Options:
  Acute pyelonephritis
  Hydronephrosis
✓ Renal cell carcinoma
  Transitional cell carcinoma
  Ureteral stone

Explanation:
The classic triad of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable abdominal mass. While the full triad is rare, the combination of these symptoms with weight loss and a solid enhancing renal mass on CT is diagnostic for RCC.

================================================================================
Question 872 (NWSM - 2025)

✓ Activation of aldosterone
  Gestational diabetes
  Increased levels of insulin
  Ketogenesis
  Physiologic volume overload

Explanation:
Pregnancy is characterized by a physiologic hyperaldosteronism, which promotes sodium and water retention (leading to edema). While sodium levels usually remain normal due to water retention, aldosterone is the specific hormonal driver for sodium retention listed.

================================================================================
Question 873 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#28 In a given industry WHO recommends a normal range of noise level (dBA) because long term exposure to noise pollution can cause auditory fatigue and loss of hearing in workers. An expert in ergonomics monitored the 8 hour average sound pressure level in a factory by using a sound level meter . The result was 40 decibels (dBA). What is the most appropriate conclusion drawn from this observation?

Options:
  The result is inconclusive
  this sound may cause auditory fatigue
  The sound level is higher than accepted range
✓ The sound level is within accepted range
  There is a risk of permanent loss of hearing

Explanation:
The occupational exposure limit for noise is typically 85 dBA for an 8-hour shift. 40 dBA is a low noise level (comparable to a quiet library or office), well within the safe/accepted range.

================================================================================

Question 928 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#89 A 68-year-old man presents with a chief complaint of "always feeling like I have to go, especially at night." He describes urinary frequency, nocturia (4 times per night), and urgency, but his urinary stream is only slightly weakened. A digital rectal exam (DRE) confirms a symmetrically enlarged, smooth prostate. His post-void residual (PVR) ultrasound is 30 mL. Which of the following is the most likely primary pathophysiological mechanism responsible for this patient's predominant storage symptoms (frequency, urgency, nocturia)?

Options:
✓ Detrusor muscle instability and overactivity secondary to outflow obstruction.
  Decreased bladder compliance due to collagen deposition from chronic overdistension.
  Increased alpha-adrenergic tone in the bladder neck and prostatic stroma.
  Static obstruction from the enlarged prostate lobes physically compressing the urethra.
  Secondary polyuria from impaired renal concentrating ability

Explanation:
BPH causes both voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) symptoms. Storage symptoms like urgency and frequency are often due to detrusor instability/overactivity, which develops as the bladder muscle hypertrophies in response to obstruction.

Options:
  urine analysis
  urine PCR
✓ renal biopsy
  ultrasound KUB
  24 hours urinary protein

Explanation:
While urine studies confirm proteinuria, the 'Gold Standard' for diagnosing the underlying cause (histopathology) of Nephrotic Syndrome, especially in adults or those with complications/systemic disease (like Lymphoma), is a Renal Biopsy.

================================================================================
Question 946 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#107 A 28 year old woman presents with 6 weeks amenorrhea,mild lower abdominal pain and spotting per vaginum .Her BHCG is 18001U/L and trans vaginal ultrasound shows empty uterus .Next step?

Options:
  Laprotomy
✓ Laparoscopy
  Methotrexate
  Dilatation and curretage
  Repeat BHCG in 48 hours

Explanation:
A BHCG of 1800 IU/L is near or above the discriminatory zone (typically 1500-2000 IU/L). If the uterus is empty at this level, it is highly suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy. Diagnostic Laparoscopy is the standard next step to visualize and treat the ectopic, especially if the diagnosis is highly probable or the patient needs definitive management.

================================================================================
Question 947 (NWSM - 2025)

Combined oral contraceptive pills can sometimes increase the risk of genital fungal infections (vulvovaginal candidiasis) due to changes in vaginal flora and glycogen content. They generally improve conditions like hirsutism, endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and PMS.

================================================================================
Question 1012 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Mechanism of OCP include of following except?

Options:
  Ovulation suppression
✓ Enhanced ovarian androgen production
  Altered cervical mucus
  Altered endometrium
  Altered tubal motility

Explanation:
Combined oral contraceptive pills work primarily by suppressing ovulation, altering cervical mucus (making it thicker and less penetrable by sperm), and changing the endometrium (making it less receptive to implantation). They do not enhance ovarian androgen production; in fact, many COCs can reduce it. They can also alter tubal motility.

================================================================================
Question 1013 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The main symptom of menopause is:

Options:
  Hot flashes
  Night sweats
  Vaginal dryness
  Sleep disturbances

Question:
Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Which hormone is thought to mediate this effect?

Options:
  Testosterone
✓ Estrogen
  Insulin like growth factor I
  Thyroxine
  Growth hormone

Explanation:
Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer primarily through higher levels of circulating estrogen. Adipose tissue contains aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgens into estrogen, leading to unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium.

================================================================================
Question 1017 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Choice adjective treatment for endometrial carcinoma stage 1 grade IV?

Options:
  Radiotherapy
  Chemotherapy
✓ Chemotherapy+radiotherapy
  No treatment
  Methotrexate only

Explanation:
For high-risk endometrial carcinoma, such as Stage 1 Grade IV (likely a typo, usually high grade is considered with deeper invasion or specific histologies), combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often used as adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence risk. However, it's crucial to clarify 'Grade IV' as endometrial cancer is typically graded I, II, or III. Assuming this implies a very aggressive tumor, combination therapy is indicated.

================================================================================

Question:
Fibroid uterus may present with all of the following except?

Options:
✓ Amenorrhea
  Irregular menstrual cycle
  Infertility
  Pelvic mass
  Poly menorrhoea

Explanation:
Uterine fibroids commonly cause menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) and polymenorrhea (frequent bleeding), irregular cycles, a palpable pelvic mass, and can contribute to infertility. Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) is not typically a symptom of fibroids; in fact, they usually cause bleeding abnormalities.

================================================================================

Raloxifene, a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), reduces the risk of osteoporosis and breast cancer. However, similar to estrogen, it increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

================================================================================
Question 1044 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 53-year-old woman with Type 2 diabetes mellitus is started on glyburide. Which of the following is a main mechanism by which this drug and others of its class lower blood glucose levels?

Options:
  Decrease insulin resistance by lowering body weight
  Enhance renal excretion of glucose
  Increase insulin synthesis
  Promote glucose uptake by muscle, liver, and adipose tissue via an insulin independent process
✓ Release insulin from the pancreas

Explanation:
Glyburide is a sulfonylurea that primarily works by stimulating the pancreatic beta cells to release more endogenous insulin. It achieves this by binding to and closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the beta-cell membrane.

================================================================================
Question 1045 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A man with Type 2 diabetes is receiving a combination of oral drugs to maintain glycemic control. He becomes hypoglycemic and ingests a glucose containing product marketed to manage such an event. It doesn't work; his blood glucose levels remain low, his symptoms persist. Which of the following antidiabetic drugs was he most likely taking?

Options:
✓ Acarbose
  Glyburide
  Metformin
  Repaglinide
  Rosiglitazone

Explanation:
Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that delays the digestion of complex carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharides. If a patient on acarbose experiences hypoglycemia, it should be treated with pure glucose (dextrose) because the absorption of complex sugars (like sucrose) will be inhibited by the drug, rendering them ineffective in rapidly raising blood glucose.

================================================================================
Question 1046 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Common adverse effect associated with the use of spironolactone is;

Options:
  Hypoglycemia
✓ Hyperkalemia
  Bradycardia
  Respiratory depression
  Photosensitivity

Explanation:
Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and an aldosterone antagonist. Its most common and clinically significant electrolyte-related adverse effect is hyperkalemia due to its mechanism of action, which leads to retention of potassium.

================================================================================

Hemorrhagic lung disorder resulting in coughing of blood associated with glomerulonephritis is commonly seen in:

Options:
  SLE
  Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis
  Polyarteritis Nodosa
✓ Good pasture syndrome
  Membranous glomerulonephritis

Explanation:
Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies, which cause rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and necrotizing hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonitis, leading to hemoptysis (coughing of blood).

================================================================================

Options:
  Membranous glomerulonephritis
✓ Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
  Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
  Ig A nephropathy
  Diabetes mellitus

Explanation:
The 'tram-track appearance' on kidney biopsy is a characteristic histological finding of Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN). It results from mesangial cell interposition and duplication of the glomerular basement membrane.

================================================================================
Question 1054 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 54 -year- old Woman has had recurrent urinary track infections for the past 15 years. on many of these occasions, proteus mirabilis was cultured from her urine. For the past 4 days, she has had a burning pain on urination and urinary frequency. Urinalysis shows as pH of 7.5; specific gravity, 1.020; 1+ hematuria; and no protein, glucose, or ketones microscopic examination of the urine shows many RBC,s WBC,s and triple phosphate crystals, which of the following renal lesions is most likely to be present?

Options:
  Acute tubular injury
  Malignant nephrosclerosis
  Papillary necrosis
  Renal cell carcinoma
✓ Staghorn calculus

Explanation:
Recurrent urinary tract infections with *Proteus mirabilis*, an alkaline urine pH, and the presence of triple phosphate crystals are highly indicative of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stone formation. These stones can grow large, filling the renal pelvis and calyces, forming a 'staghorn calculus'.

================================================================================
Question 1055 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Options:
  Membranous glomerulonephritis
  Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
  Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis
  Lupus nephritis
✓ Crescentic glomerulonephritis

Explanation:
The rapid development of acute renal failure in the setting of nephritic syndrome, often following an infection (flu-like illness), is characteristic of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). Histologically, RPGN is defined by the presence of crescents in the glomeruli, hence 'crescentic glomerulonephritis'.

================================================================================
Question 1056 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4 year old boy presented with palpable mass in flank with history of weight loss, MRI reveals mass in kidney, histopathology of mass reveals round blue cell with interspread tubules. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Renal papillary adenoma
✓ Nephroblastoma /Wilms tumor
  Cortical adenoma
  Renal clear cell carcinoma
  Renal papillary carcinoma

Explanation:
The clinical presentation (palpable flank mass in a young child, weight loss) and histological findings (round blue cells with interspread tubules, often triphasic) are classic for Nephroblastoma, commonly known as Wilms tumor, the most common malignant renal tumor of childhood.

================================================================================

✓ Diffuse and nodular mesangial sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules)
  Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
  Amyloidosis and GBM thickening
  Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis and tubulointerstitial nephritis

Explanation:
The patient's long history of diabetes (indicated by polyuria, polydipsia, high HbA1c), obesity, and proteinuria are highly suggestive of diabetic nephropathy. The characteristic kidney lesions of diabetic nephropathy include diffuse glomerulosclerosis and the formation of nodular mesangial sclerosis, known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules.

================================================================================
Question 1059 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Following disease present only as nephritic syndrome?

Options:
  Membranous glomerulonephritis
✓ Acute post infectious glomerulonephritis
  Minimal change disease
  Diabetic nephropathy
  Lupus nephritis

Explanation:
Acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis (e.g., post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) classically presents as an acute nephritic syndrome, characterized by hematuria, oliguria, hypertension, and edema. Other options can present as nephrotic syndrome, mixed nephritic-nephrotic syndromes, or have variable presentations.

================================================================================
Question 1060 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old woman HCV positive had periorbital edema. On detailed investigation her proteinuria was 5mg /dl / 24hrs. Renal biopsy revealed thickened basement membranes and spikes in silver stain. What would be the likely finding on electron microscopy?

Options:
✓ Subepithelial immune complex deposition
  Subendothelial immune complex deposition
  Mesengial immune complex deposition
  Intramembranous immune complex deposition
  No immune complex deposition

Explanation:
The renal biopsy findings of thickened basement membranes and 'spikes' on silver stain are classic for membranous glomerulonephritis. This condition is characterized by subepithelial immune complex deposition on electron microscopy. (Assuming the proteinuria value is a typo and refers to nephrotic range proteinuria, e.g., >3.5g/24hrs).

================================================================================
Question 1061 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In minimial change disease, the principal lesion is in:

Options:
✓ Visceral epithelial cells
  Parietal epithelial cells
  Mesangial cells
  Endothelial cells
  Both mesangial and endothelial cells

Explanation:
In minimal change disease, the principal pathological lesion is the effacement (fusion) of the foot processes of the visceral epithelial cells (podocytes), which are crucial for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier. This change is not visible by light microscopy, hence 'minimal change'.

================================================================================
Question 1063 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42-year-old woman has noted increasing fullness in her neck for the past 7 month. Her mother is diagnosed as MEN 2 syndrome. On physical examination, her thyroid gland is diffusely and asymmetrically enlarged and nodular. There is no lymphadenopathy. She undergoes thyroidectomy. Gross examination of the thyroid shows a multicentric thyroid neoplasm; microscopically, the neoplasm is composed of polygonal-to spindle-shaped cells forming nests and trabeculae. There is a prominent, pink hyaline stroma that stains positively with congo red and gives apple green birefringence on polarized lens. Levels of which hormone would be most likely raised in this thyroid neoplasm?

Options:
✓ Calcitonin
  CD3
  Cytokeratin
  Estrogen receptor
  Parathyroid hormone

Explanation:
The family history of MEN 2 syndrome, the microscopic description of polygonal/spindle cells forming nests and trabeculae with a prominent, pink hyaline stroma that stains positively with Congo red (indicating amyloid), are classic features of medullary thyroid carcinoma. This tumor originates from parafollicular C cells and secretes calcitonin, hence elevated calcitonin levels are expected.

================================================================================
Question 1064 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 44-year-old, otherwise healthy woman feels a small lump on the left side of her neck. A firm, painless, 1.5-cm cervical lymph node is palpable. The thyroid gland is not enlarged. A chest radiograph is unremarkable. Laboratory findings reveal normal TFTs. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland is done which reveal follicular cells forming papillae like structures with cleared nuclei, nuclear grooves and some nuclear inclusions. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Anaplastic carcinoma
  Follicular carcinoma
  Medullary carcinoma
✓ Papillary carcinoma
  Parathyroid carcinoma

Explanation:
The histopathological findings of follicular cells forming papillary structures, along with characteristic nuclear features like cleared (Orphan Annie eye) nuclei, nuclear grooves, and intranuclear inclusions, are pathognomonic for papillary thyroid carcinoma. The palpable cervical lymph node suggests metastatic spread, which is common with papillary carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 1065 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Hyperfunction of anterior pituitary in pre-pubertal children generally results in:

Options:
  Acromegaly
  Addisons disease
  Cushing syndrome
✓ Gigantism
  Hyperprolactinemia

Explanation:
Hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary, specifically overproduction of growth hormone (GH), in pre-pubertal children (before the epiphyseal growth plates have fused) results in gigantism, characterized by excessive linear growth.

================================================================================
Question 1066 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 43-year-old woman has had increasing lethargy and weakness over the past 3 years. She has cold intolerance and she wears a sweater in the summer. One year ago, she had menorrhagia, but now she has oligomenorrhea. She has difficulty in concentrating and her memory is poor. She has chronic constipation too. On physical examination she has alopecia, and her skin appears coarse and dry. Her face, hands, and feet appear puffy. Microscope appearance of her causative disease should thyroid gland diffusely infiltrated by lymphocytes forming lymphoid follicles with visible germinal centers and pinkish appearing cells. Which of the following serologic test findings is most likely to be positive in this woman?

Options:
  Anticentromere antibody
  Anti-double-stranded DNA antibody
  Anti-jo-1 antibody
  Antimitochondrial antibody
✓ Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody

Explanation:
The clinical presentation (lethargy, weakness, cold intolerance, cognitive issues, constipation, dry/puffy skin, alopecia) and the microscopic thyroid biopsy findings (diffuse lymphocytic infiltration, lymphoid follicles, germinal centers) are classic for Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis), which is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies are the most frequently positive serologic markers in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

================================================================================
Question 1067 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A two year old child has failure to thrive since infancy. Physical examination show that the child is short and has coarse facial features, a protruding tongue, and an umbilical hernia. As the child matures, profound intellectual disability becomes apparent. A deficiency of which of the following hormones is most likely to explain these findings?

Options:
  Cortisol
  Insulin
  Norepinephrine
  Somatostatin
✓ Thyroxine (T4)

Explanation:
The clinical features of failure to thrive, short stature, coarse facial features, protruding tongue, umbilical hernia, and profound intellectual disability are characteristic of congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism), which is caused by a deficiency of thyroxine (T4).

================================================================================
Question 1068 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Name of first signal line test for thyroid function evaluation is:

Options:
  T4

Options:
  HbA1c
  Serum cortisol
✓ MRI scan of pituitary
  Thyroid function test
  Serum ACTH

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (visual problems, headache, increased shoe size, big moist hands, hirsutism, hypertension, and recent diabetes diagnosis) are highly suggestive of acromegaly, caused by a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. An MRI scan of the pituitary is the definitive diagnostic imaging test to visualize such a tumor.

================================================================================
Question 1070 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A diabetic patient on insulin therapy presents in an unconscious state to Emergency Department. His blood glucose is 35mg/dl. What is the appropriate treatment?

Options:
  Insulin 12 units I/V state
  Infusion of normal saline
  Infusion of Ringer Lactate
  Injection naloxone
✓ Injection glucagon

Explanation:
For an unconscious diabetic patient with severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose 35mg/dl), injection of glucagon is the appropriate immediate treatment, especially in an emergency setting or pre-hospital, as it rapidly raises blood glucose by stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis. Intravenous glucose would also be appropriate if readily available and the patient has IV access.

================================================================================
Question 1071 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Delayed relaxation phase of ankle jerk is a sign?

Options:
  Anxiety
  Cushing syndrome

  DM
✓ Hypothyroidism

Explanation:
Delayed relaxation of the ankle jerk reflex (Achilles reflex) is a classic physical sign of hypothyroidism, reflecting the slowed muscle contraction and relaxation characteristic of the condition.

================================================================================
Question 1072 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 year old woman presented with central obesity, round face and purple marks on the abdomen. She has been taking Hakimi drugs for joint pains for the last 3 years. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Addisons disease
  Chronic kidney disease
✓ Cushings syndrome
  Type 2 diabetes
  Metabolic syndrome

Explanation:
The clinical features of central obesity, round face (moon facies), and purple striae (stretch marks) are classic for Cushing's syndrome. The history of taking 'Hakimi drugs' (traditional medicines) for joint pains strongly suggests exogenous glucocorticoid intake, which is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 1073 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old female complains of fatigue, muscle weakness and depression. She is pregnant with her second child and has a history of autoimmune disorders. Lab tests reveal elevated serum calcium and PTH levels. What is the likely cause of hyperparathyroidism in this patient:

Options:
  Pregnancy-related changes
  Addison's disease
✓ Primary hyperparathyroidism
  Gestational diabetes
  Hypothyroidism

Explanation:
The presence of elevated serum calcium and elevated PTH levels confirms hyperparathyroidism. In the absence of renal failure, this is characteristic of primary hyperparathyroidism, often caused by a parathyroid adenoma. Pregnancy and autoimmune disorders do not directly cause primary hyperparathyroidism.

================================================================================
Question 1074 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old individual with type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency room with symptoms of confusion, shakiness, and sweating. The patient mentions taking their regular diabetes medication earlier in the day. On examination their blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 90bpm, and blood glucose level is 55mg/dl. What is the most appropriate next step?

Options:
  Administer intravenous (IV) insulin
✓ Administer hypertonic glucose
  Administer an oral antidiabetic medication
  Initiate long-term glucose-lowering therapy
  Order haemoglobin A1c test

Explanation:
The patient is experiencing symptomatic hypoglycemia (confusion, shakiness, sweating) with a very low blood glucose level (55mg/dl). The most appropriate and immediate next step is to administer hypertonic glucose (e.g., D50W intravenously) to rapidly raise blood glucose and reverse the hypoglycemia.

================================================================================
Question 1075 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which parameters must be used in assessment of short stature?

Options:
  Child's height
  Siblings height
  Parent's height
  Mid parental height
✓ All of above

Explanation:
A comprehensive assessment of short stature requires considering all these parameters: the child's actual height, the height of siblings (to compare against familial patterns), and parental heights (to calculate mid-parental height, which estimates genetic growth potential). All contribute to differentiating between normal familial short stature, constitutional growth delay, and pathological short stature.
