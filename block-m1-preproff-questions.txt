================================================================================
Question 8 (AMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 11-year-old boy with ear disease for the past 7 years came to the emergency with fever and swelling behind the ear. He also has pain which is throbbing in nature. What is the confirmatory sign for mastoiditis in this child?

Options:
✓ a. Postauricular abscess
  b. Absent retroauricular sulcus
  c. High-grade fever
  d. Discharge in the ear
  e. Neck node swelling

Explanation:
Acute mastoiditis is clinically diagnosed by signs including mastoid tenderness and swelling. A 'postauricular abscess' (pus collection behind the ear) confirms the spread of infection through the mastoid cortex. Note: In mastoiditis, the retroauricular sulcus is typically preserved (pinna pushed forward/down), whereas in furunculosis it is obliterated.

================================================================================
Question 9 (AMC - 2023)

Options:
  a. CT scan
  b. X-ray of the skull
  c. MRI brain
  d. Culture and sensitivity of the discharge
✓ e. Beta 2 transferrin

Explanation:
Beta-2 transferrin is a protein found uniquely in CSF (and perilymph/aqueous humor) but not in nasal secretions, making its detection the gold standard/most specific test for confirming CSF rhinorrhea.

================================================================================
Question 30 (AMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A Young male presented in ENT OPD with nasal obstruction occasional epistaxis and conductive deafness, his palate is pushed downwards and he has bilateral neck nodes. What is your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  a. AC polyp
  b. Ethmoidal polyp
  c. Carcinoma larynx
  d. Carcinoma nasopharynx
✓ e. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma

Explanation:
The classic presentation of a Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA) is in a 'Young male' with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and a large mass that may push the soft palate downwards ('frog face' deformity). While neck nodes are more typical of carcinoma, the age and specific signs like palate displacement strongly favor JNA in MCQ contexts.

================================================================================
Question 31 (AMC - 2023)
================================================================================

  b. Lingual gland
✓ c. Submandibular gland
  d. Minor salivary glands
  e. Tonsils

Explanation:
Sialolithiasis (stone formation) is most common in the Submandibular gland (80-90%) due to the alkaline, mucinous nature of its saliva and the antigravity drainage of Wharton's duct.

================================================================================
Question 34 (AMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old male undergoes a right superficial parotidectomy. Eight months later he presents to the outpatient department complaining of flushing and sweating of the right side of his face on eating.

Question 42 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following statements is true?

Options:
✓ Korner's septum in the mastoid separates squamous cells from the deeper petrosal cells
  Facial recess lies medial to the sinus tympani
  Trautmann's triangle forms an important surgical landmark to locate endolymphatic sac
  Arcuate eminence is landmark for lateral semicircular canal
  facial nerve is never dehiscent

Explanation:
Korner's septum (petrosquamous septum) is a persistent bony plate in the mastoid that separates the superficial squamous air cells from the deeper petrous air cells. This can be an important surgical landmark to ensure complete removal of mastoid air cells.

================================================================================
Question 43 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
During superficial parotidectomy, the most reliable landmark to identify main trunk of facial nerve is?

Options:
  Mastoid tip
  Styloid process
✓ Tympanomastoid suture
  Cartilage of external auditory canal
  great auricular nerve

Explanation:
The tympanomastoid suture is considered the most reliable bony landmark for locating the main trunk of the facial nerve during parotid surgery. The nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen approximately 6-8 mm deep to the tympanomastoid suture.

================================================================================
Question 44 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Operation of choice for coalescent mastoiditis is?

Options:
✓ Cortical mastoidectomy
  Modified radical mastoidectomy
  Radical mastoidectomy
  Fenestration operation
  combine approach tympanoplasty

Explanation:
Coalescent mastoiditis is an acute complication of acute otitis media where the mastoid air cell septa break down. The treatment of choice is cortical mastoidectomy (Schwartze operation), which drains the mastoid abscess and removes infected air cells while preserving the middle ear structures.

================================================================================
Question 45 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38-year-old gentleman reports of decreased hearing in the right ear for the last 2 years. On testing with a 512-Hz tuning fork, the Rinne's test (without masking) is negative on the right ear and positive on the left ear. With the Weber's test the tone is perceived louder in the left ear. The patient most likely has?

Options:
  Right conductive hearing loss
  Right sensorineural hearing loss
  Left sensorineural hearing loss
  Left conductive hearing loss
✓ left ear profound hearing loss

Explanation:
This scenario describes a 'false negative' Rinne test on the right. A negative Rinne usually means conductive loss (BC > AC), but if Weber lateralizes to the *opposite* (better) ear (left in this case), it suggests a profound sensorineural hearing loss (dead ear) on the right. The patient hears the bone conduction on the right side via the left cochlea (cross-hearing). Thus, this is a case of right-sided profound sensorineural hearing loss (or a 'dead ear'). Note: The options might be tricky. E says 'left ear profound...', but the description fits a right dead ear. However, if we reinterpret: Rinne negative Right (BC>AC), Positive Left (AC>BC). Weber to Left. This is classic for Right Severe SNHL (False Negative Rinne). But if the options don't list Right Severe SNHL, let's re-evaluate. If it were Right Conductive, Weber would go to the Right. It goes to Left. So it's Right SNHL. Option B is Right SNHL. But profound loss creates the false negative Rinne. Let's assume standard interpretation: Weber to better ear = SNHL in worse ear. Rinne false negative confirms severe/profound loss. So B or E (if E said right). Assuming typo in E or B is intended.

================================================================================
Question 46 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is not a typical feature of Meniere's disease?

Options:
  Sensorineural deafness

Question:
Which of the following is true regarding facial nerve palsy associated with temporal bone fracture?

Options:
  Common with longitudinal fracture
✓ Common with transverse fracture
  Always associated with CSF otorrhoea
  Facial nerve injury is always complete
  facial nerve injury is always incomplete

Explanation:
Facial nerve palsy is much more common (approx. 50%) with transverse fractures of the temporal bone compared to longitudinal fractures (approx. 20%), even though longitudinal fractures are more common overall. Transverse fractures often traverse the internal auditory canal or the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve.

================================================================================
Question 48 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In right middle ear pathology, Weber's test will be?

Options:
  Normal
  Centralised
✓ Lateralised to right side
  Lateralised to left side
  bilateral profound hearing loss

Explanation:
Middle ear pathology (like effusion, perforation, or ossicular fixation) typically causes conductive hearing loss. In unilateral conductive hearing loss (right side in this case), the Weber test lateralizes to the affected (right) ear.

================================================================================

Question:
Decreased bone conduction in an audiogram indicates?

Options:
  Tympanic membrane perforation
  Ossicular dislocation
  Ossicular fixation
✓ Damage to cochlea
  Wax

Explanation:
Bone conduction thresholds on an audiogram represent the reserve of the cochlea (inner ear function). Decreased bone conduction (elevated thresholds) indicates sensorineural hearing loss, which implies damage to the cochlea or the auditory nerve.

================================================================================
Question 51 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Aim of mastoid surgery in CSOM which should receive first priority is?

Options:
  Making the ear dry
  Improvement in hearing
  Preservation of hearing
✓ Rendering the ear safe
  making the ear water safe

Explanation:
The primary goal of mastoid surgery in chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), especially the unsafe type (with cholesteatoma), is to render the ear 'safe' by eradicating the disease and preventing life-threatening intracranial and extracranial complications. Hearing improvement and a dry ear are secondary goals.

================================================================================
Question 52 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Treatment of dry traumatic rupture of tympanic membrane is?

Options:
  Antibiotic ear drops
  Myringoplasty
✓ Protection of ear against water
  Ear pack soaked with antibiotic
  mastoidectomy

Explanation:
For a traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane that is dry and not infected, the standard treatment is conservative management, which primarily involves protecting the ear from water entry to prevent infection. Most of these perforations heal spontaneously.

================================================================================
Question 53 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
All are true about ear wax except?

Options:
  pH is acidic in normal healthy canals
✓ Needs to be removed periodically
  Contains a bactericidal enzymes
  Is a combination of secretions of sebaceous and apocrine glands
  sometime it needs surgery

Explanation:
Ear wax (cerumen) is a normal, protective substance. In most healthy individuals, the ear canal is self-cleaning (epithelial migration), and wax does *not* need to be removed periodically unless it becomes impacted and causes symptoms.

================================================================================
Question 54 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Perforation commonly associated with cholesteatoma is?

Options:
✓ Attic
  Kidney-shaped central perforation
  Perforation of pars tensa posterior to handle of malleus
  Perforation anterior to handle of malleus
  subtotal

Explanation:
Cholesteatoma is most commonly associated with attic (pars flaccida) perforations or posterior-superior marginal perforations of the pars tensa. These are considered 'unsafe' perforations.

================================================================================
Question 55 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Extra cranial complications of CSOM?

Options:
  Epidural abscess
✓ Facial nerve palsy
  Brain Abscess
  Subdural Abscess

Question:
Which of the following is/are true about cholestea-toma?

Options:
  It is a benign tumour
  Metastasises to lymph node
  Contains cholesterol
✓ Erodes bone
  Malignant potential

Explanation:
Cholesteatoma is a destructive lesion (skin cyst) in the middle ear. Its most significant and dangerous characteristic is its ability to erode bone, which can lead to complications like hearing loss, facial palsy, and intracranial infections. It is not a true neoplasm (tumor) and does not metastasize.

================================================================================
Question 57 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Treatment of choice in postauricular abscess as a complication of otitis media is?

Options:
  Incision and drainage (I and d)
  I and D plus antibiotics
  Aspiration and antibiotics
✓ I and d, antibiotics and mastoidectomy
  suction and clearance

Explanation:
A postauricular abscess indicates coalescent mastoiditis breaking through the mastoid cortex. The definitive treatment involves incision and drainage of the abscess, high-dose antibiotics, and cortical mastoidectomy to remove the source of infection in the mastoid air cells.

================================================================================
Question 58 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5-year-old boy has been diagnosed to have postero-superior retraction pocket with cholesteatoma. All would constitute part of management except?

Options:
  Audiometry
  Mastoid exploration
  Tympanoplasty
  Myringoplasty
✓ observation only

Explanation:
A cholesteatoma in a child is an unsafe and potentially progressive condition. 'Observation only' is not an appropriate management strategy. Active management including audiometry, mastoid exploration (surgery to remove disease), and tympanoplasty/myringoplasty (reconstruction) is required.

================================================================================
Question 59 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Picket-fence graph of temperature is seen in?

Options:
  Otitic hydrocephalus
✓ Lateral sinus thrombosis
  Extradural abscess
  Meningitis

  CN XI PALSY
  facial nerve palsy

Explanation:
Gradenigo's syndrome is characterized by the triad of: 1. Otorrhea (from otitis media), 2. Retro-orbital pain (trigeminal nerve involvement), and 3. Diplopia due to Lateral Rectus palsy (Abducens/VI nerve involvement).

================================================================================
Question 61 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10-year-old boy presents with torticollis, a tender swelling behind the angle of mandible and fever. He had history of ear discharge for the past 6 years. Examination of the ear showed purulent discharge and granulations in the ear canal. Most probable diagnosis is?

Options:
  Acute lymphadenitis secondary to otitis externa
  Masked mastoiditis
✓ Bezold abscess
  Parotitis
  brain abscess

Explanation:
The clinical picture of chronic ear discharge, fever, tender swelling in the neck (behind the angle of the mandible, along the sternocleidomastoid), and torticollis is classic for a Bezold's abscess. This occurs when a mastoid abscess erodes through the mastoid tip into the neck muscles.

================================================================================
Question 62 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
MRI is the Investigation of choice in all of the following complications of CSOM except?

Options:
  Extradural abscess
  Bezold abscess
✓ Coalescent mastoiditis
  Cerebral abscess
  facial nerve palsy

Explanation:
For coalescent mastoiditis (a bony pathology), a high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone is the investigation of choice to visualize bone erosion and air cell septation. MRI is superior for soft tissue complications like intracranial abscesses, sinus thrombosis, and facial nerve enhancement, but CT is better for the mastoid bone itself.

================================================================================

Question:
Indications for tracheostomy are all EXCEPT?

Options:
  Acute epiglottitis
  Maxillofacial trauma
  Laryngeal malignancy
✓ Extensive consolidation of lung
  ICU patient

Explanation:
Tracheostomy is indicated for upper airway obstruction (like epiglottitis, malignancy, trauma) and for prolonged ventilation (ICU patients). Extensive consolidation of the lung (pneumonia) is a lower respiratory tract issue that is typically managed with medical therapy and potentially intubation/ventilation if failure occurs, but it is not a primary indication for tracheostomy itself unless prolonged ventilation is needed.

================================================================================
Question 83 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Most common complication of Tracheostomy is?

Options:
  Stenosis
✓ Infection
  Pneumonia
  Respiratory failure
  death

================================================================================
Question 92 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The antibiotic of choice in acute epiglottitis pending culture sensitivity report is?

Options:
  Erythromycin
  Rolitetracycline
  Doxycycline
✓ Ampicillin
  ciprofloxacin

Explanation:
Acute epiglottitis is a medical emergency often caused by *Haemophilus influenzae*. Third-generation cephalosporins (like ceftriaxone) are typically the first line. However, among the older options listed, Ampicillin (often with sulbactam or chloramphenicol in historical contexts) was a standard choice, though resistance is now common. In exam contexts with these specific options, Ampicillin or Ceftriaxone (if listed) would be chosen. Given the list, Ampicillin is the most appropriate class compared to tetracyclines or erythromycin for this severe infection.

================================================================================

Options:
  General endoscopy
  Cessation of smoking
  Micro laryngeal surgery for biopsy
  Regular follow-up
✓ Tracheostomy

Explanation:
For a suspicious laryngeal lesion in a smoker, biopsy and evaluation are crucial. Tracheostomy is indicated only for airway obstruction, which is not mentioned here; therefore, it is not part of the immediate management plan.

================================================================================
Question 154 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A case of carcinoma larynx with the involvement of anterior commisure and right vocal cord developed perichondritis of thyroid cartilage. Which one of the following statement is true for the management of this case?

Options:
  He should first receive radiotherapy and if residual tumor is present then should undergo laryngectomy
  He should be given chemotherapy and then radiotherapy
  He should be given radical radiotherapy as this can cure early tumors
  He should be treated with combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy
✓ He should first undergo laryngectomy and then postoperative radiotherapy

Explanation:
Involvement of the thyroid cartilage (perichondritis/invasion) typically upstages laryngeal cancer to T4. Radiotherapy is generally less effective when there is cartilage involvement or perichondritis. Total laryngectomy followed by postoperative radiotherapy is the standard curative approach for such advanced disease.

================================================================================
Question 155 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

  Radical neck dissection for N neck
  Radical neck dissection where nodes are palpable
  Radical neck dissection with preservation of internal jugular vein
✓ Removal of some lymph node groups while sparing the others

Explanation:
Elective neck dissection (usually a selective neck dissection) involves removing lymph nodes from the neck in a patient with no clinical evidence of metastasis (N0 neck) to treat occult disease. It typically spares non-lymphatic structures and some node levels.

================================================================================
Question 166 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following structures are preserved in a radical neck dissection?

Options:
  Hypoglossal, vagus and spinal accessory
  External jugular vein and external laryngeal nerve
  Sternocleidomastoid & glossopharyngeal nerve
✓ Sternocleidomastoid, spinal accessory and vagus nerve

Explanation:
A classic radical neck dissection removes the SCM, IJV, and spinal accessory nerve. However, the question asks what is *preserved*. The vagus nerve is preserved. The options are confusing or contain errors (e.g., option d lists SCM and accessory nerve which are *removed*). Assuming the question implies a *modified* radical or is testing knowledge of what is *not* taken, Vagus is the key structure preserved. But standard RND sacrifices XI. The vagus is preserved.

✓ Group-A beta hemolytic streptococcus
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  Staphylococcus aureus
  Moraxella catarrhalis

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of sore throat, odynophagia (painful swallowing), fever, and tonsils covered with purulent discharge (exudative tonsillitis) is highly suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat), most commonly caused by Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus (*Streptococcus pyogenes*).

================================================================================
Question 214 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old lady came to the ENT-OPD with difficulty in breathing for 01 month. On IDL examination, both vocal cords were in paramedian position. Which muscle is responsible for the abduction of the vocal cords?

Options:
  Cricothyroid muscle
  Interarytenoid muscle
  Thyroarytenoid muscle
  Lateral cricoarytenoid muscle
✓ Posterior cricoarytenoid

Explanation:
The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle is the sole abductor of the vocal cords. Bilateral vocal cords in the paramedian position (partially abducted, but not fully) can cause significant airway obstruction and difficulty breathing.

================================================================================
Question 215 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2 years child came to the emergency department with dyspnea, high grade fever and drooling of saliva for the last 2 days. On examination of the oropharynx, there was hyperemic and congested mucosa of the pharynx and epiglottis. It was diagnosed as epiglottis. Which organism is responsible for this condition?

Options:
  Staphylococcus epidermidis
  E-coli
  Moraxella catarrhalis
  Streptococcus pneumoniae
✓ Influenza type-B

Explanation:
*Haemophilus influenzae* type B (Hib) was historically the most common causative organism of acute epiglottitis, particularly in children. While Hib vaccination has dramatically reduced its incidence, it remains a possible cause, and other bacteria like *Streptococcus pneumoniae* can also cause it. The option states 'Influenza type-B', which is likely a typo and meant *Haemophilus influenzae* type B.

================================================================================
Question 216 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 years old child presents with difficulty in breathing for the last 6 months especially during sleep at night.

It is the diagnosed case obstructive sleep apnea. what is the most probable cause?

Options:
  Recurrent sinusitis
  Allergic rhinitis
  Adenoiditis
  Unilateral rhinolith
✓ Chronic adenotonsillitis

Explanation:
In children, chronic adenotonsillitis (enlargement of the adenoids and tonsils) is the most common anatomical cause of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Enlarged tonsils and adenoids physically obstruct the upper airway during sleep.

================================================================================
Question 217 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old male, came to ENT department with hoarseness of voice and cough for the last 5 months. He is a trumpet player by profession.

What is your likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Thyroglossal cyst
✓ Laryngocele
  Vocal cord polyp
  Thyroid nodule
  Laryngeal papillomatosis

Explanation:
A reducible neck swelling that increases in size with coughing or Valsalva maneuver, particularly in a trumpet player (who regularly performs Valsalva), along with hoarseness and cough, is highly characteristic of a laryngocele. This is an abnormal air-filled sac in the larynx, often communicating with the laryngeal ventricle.

================================================================================
Question 218 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old male presented to the ENT OPD with a history of the intermittent swelling of the left side of the neck for one month and it was having association with intake of meals, which subsides after 2 hours.

Options:
  Sialometaplasia
✓ Sialolithiasis

Explanation:
Intermittent swelling in the submandibular region that is associated with meal intake and subsides after a few hours is a classic symptom of sialolithiasis (salivary gland stone), particularly in the submandibular gland. The stone obstructs the Wharton's duct, causing salivary stasis and swelling.

================================================================================
Question 219 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old male known Diabetic patient presented to ENT OPD with sudden onset of swelling left face, fever and with severe pain for 2 days, on examination of the ear, nose & throat, it was diagnosed as acute suppurative parotitis, usual route of infection in this case is?

Options:
  Infections in External auditory canal
✓ Through Stensen's duct
  Through Wharton's duct
  Infection in teeth
  Infection in parotid lymph nodes

Explanation:
Acute suppurative parotitis (bacterial infection of the parotid gland), especially in a diabetic patient, typically occurs due to ascending infection from the oral cavity via the Stensen's duct (the parotid duct).

================================================================================
Question 220 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20-year-old boy presented to the ENT OPD with severe pain in the left ear. On clinical examination, he has vesicles on the tympanic membrane, meatal skin, concha, and post-auricular groove, and also has left-sided facial nerve palsy. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Bell's palsy
  Otitis externa hemorrhagica
✓ Ramsay hunt syndrome
  Malignant otitis externa
  Otitis media

Explanation:
The presence of vesicles on the tympanic membrane, meatal skin, concha, and post-auricular groove (herpes zoster oticus), along with ipsilateral facial nerve palsy, is the classic presentation of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial paralysis), caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus.

================================================================================
Question 221 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old female known diabetic presented to ENT OPD with history of ear discharge, severe pain in the left ear for the last 10 days, on examination of the ears there was a purulent discharge and granulation tissues in the deep floor of the canal. What is your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  CSOM
✓ Malignant otitis externa
  Otitis externa
  Otomycosis
  Myringitis

Explanation:
In an elderly diabetic patient, persistent severe ear pain and purulent discharge with granulation tissue in the deep external auditory canal, extending to the bone, is highly suspicious for malignant otitis externa. This aggressive infection requires urgent and intensive treatment.

================================================================================
Question 222 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old female known diabetic presented to ENT OPD with history of severe pain in the left ear, she was diagnosed as suspected malignant otitis externa. Which is the most common bacteria responsible for this disease?

Options:
  E-coli
  Group-A beta hemolytic streptococcus
✓ Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  Staphylococcus aureus
  Moraxella catarrhalis

Explanation:
*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is overwhelmingly the most common causative bacteria responsible for malignant otitis externa, an invasive and potentially life-threatening infection of the external auditory canal and skull base, particularly in immunocompromised individuals like diabetics.

================================================================================
Question 223 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male presented to ENT OPD with history of intense itching, discomfort in the right ear, on ear examination there was fungal hyphae mixed with the ear wax. It was diagnosed as otomycosis. What is the most commonly pathogens responsible for this condition?

Options:
✓ Aspergillus
  Mucorale
  Candida
  Histoplasma
  Actinomyces

Explanation:
*Aspergillus* species (e.g., *A. niger*, *A. fumigatus*) are the most common fungal pathogens responsible for otomycosis, an opportunistic fungal infection of the external auditory canal. *Candida albicans* is another common cause.

================================================================================
Question 224 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A one-year-old child with stridor that increases on crying, direct laryngoscopy shows an elongated epiglottis, curled upon itself and short aryepiglottic folds. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Congenital vocal cord paralysis
  Laryngeal web
✓ Laryngomalacia
  Laryngeal cyst
  Laryngocele

Explanation:
The stridor that increases on crying (increased airflow velocity) but typically improves in the prone position, along with direct laryngoscopic findings of an elongated, omega-shaped epiglottis that curls inward and short aryepiglottic folds, are classic diagnostic features of laryngomalacia, the most common cause of congenital stridor.

================================================================================
Question 225 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old lady visited the ENT OPD with complaints of hearing loss. On examination doctor advised her suction clearance both ears for wax. What is the composition of ear wax?

Options:
  Menieres disease
  Superior semicircular canal dehiscence
✓ Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
  Vestibular neuronitis
  Ototoxicity

Explanation:
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo. It is characterized by brief, episodic spells of vertigo triggered by specific head movements or changes in head position, due to dislodged otoconia in the semicircular canals.

================================================================================
Question 227 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 17 years male present to ENT OPD with nasal blockage for the last one year. On nasal examination polyps was visible on right side. After investigations patient was labeled as a case of antrochoanal polyp. What is the treatment of choice for antrochoanal polyp?

Options:
  Antibiotics
  Steroids
✓ Functional Endoscopic sinus surgery
  Caldwell-luc operation
  Intranasal polypectomy

Explanation:
Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is the treatment of choice for antrochoanal polyps. It allows for complete removal of the polyp and its maxillary sinus attachment, minimizing recurrence, and is generally preferred over older, more invasive procedures like the Caldwell-Luc operation for this condition.

================================================================================
Question 228 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 adult male patient presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of painful swallowing, fever, and difficulty opening his mouth. On examination, there was edema of the uvula and palate, a medially pushed tonsil (with normal morphology), and trismus. Most likely diagnosis:

Options:
  Parapharyngeal abscess
  Acute retropharyngeal
  Acute Tonsillitis
✓ Quinsy
  Chronic retropharyngeal abscess

Explanation:
The acute onset of painful swallowing (odynophagia), fever, trismus (difficulty opening mouth), and the specific examination findings of a medially pushed tonsil with edema of the uvula and palate are classic signs of a peritonsillar abscess, commonly known as quinsy.

================================================================================
Question 229 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4 years child presented with hoarseness of voice and difficulty in breathing with inspiratory stridor. It was diagnosed as juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis. Which virus is most commonly involved in this disease?

Question 231 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
...painful swallowing, and a cough associated with blood staining in the sputum for the past 1 month. On biopsy from the larynx, it was diagnosed as TB of the larynx; which part of the larynx is most affected by tuberculosis?

Options:
  Supraglottis
  Anterior part of the larynx
  Subglottis
✓ Posterior part of the larynx
  Anterior commissure

Explanation:
Laryngeal tuberculosis most commonly affects the posterior part of the larynx, particularly the posterior commissure, arytenoids, and interarytenoid region, often presenting with dysphagia, hoarseness, and sometimes blood-stained sputum.

================================================================================
Question 232 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28-year-old female patient presented with recurrent nasal bleeding. On examination, there was septal perforation with crusting. Which one of the following is not the usual cause of septal perforation?

Options:
✓ Upper respiratory tract infection
  Syphilis
  Lupus
  Wegner's granulomatosis
  Tuberculous

Explanation:
Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are common but are not typically a direct cause of septal perforation. Septal perforations are more commonly caused by trauma, chronic inflammation, autoimmune diseases (like Lupus or Wegener's granulomatosis), infections (like syphilis, tuberculosis), or iatrogenic causes (e.g., nasal surgery).

================================================================================
Question 233 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20-year-old male patient underwent surgery for a deviated nasal septum, and the most likely cause of postoperative saddle nose deformity with supra tip depression was:

Options:
✓ Sub mucosal resection
  Medial maxillectomy
  Septoplasty
  Functional endoscopic sinus surgery
  Cautery of the septum

Explanation:
Submucosal resection (SMR), an older technique for septal deviation, carried a higher risk of removing too much septal cartilage, compromising septal support, and leading to complications like saddle nose deformity with supratip depression.

================================================================================
Question 234 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 3-year-old boy who presented to the emergency room with sudden acute respiratory distress, spasmodic cough, cyanosis, and use of accessory respiratory muscles. What is the most likely diagnosis:

Options:
  Acute epiglottitis
✓ Foreign body inhalation tracheobronchial tree
  Croup
  Laryngomalacia
  Subglottic stenosis

Explanation:
Sudden acute respiratory distress, spasmodic cough, cyanosis, and use of accessory respiratory muscles in a 3-year-old child strongly suggest a foreign body inhalation into the tracheobronchial tree, which is a medical emergency.

================================================================================
Question 235 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old man came to ENT OPD with fever & sore throat with dribbling of saliva & trismus for only 2 days. On examination, the right tonsil is hyperemic, pushed medially & forward, and edematous uvula. There is no response to antibiotics. Rapid relief can be obtained by :

Options:
  Short course of radiotherapy
  Assurance & rest
  Antidiphtheric serum
✓ Incision & drainage
  Broad spectrum antibiotics

Explanation:
The clinical presentation (fever, sore throat, dribbling saliva, trismus, medially pushed tonsil, edematous uvula) is classic for a peritonsillar abscess (quinsy). Since it's an abscess, antibiotics alone are often insufficient, and rapid relief is achieved by incision and drainage of the pus.

================================================================================
Question 236 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old female patient presented with foul smelling right ear discharge and hearing loss for 3 years. On examination, the tympanic membrane has a posterior superior marginal perforation. Which radiological investigation would you like to perform?

Options:
  Xray mastoid
  MRI
✓ CT scan of the temporal bone
  MR angiography
  CT angiogram

Explanation:
A foul-smelling ear discharge, hearing loss, and a postero-superior marginal perforation of the tympanic membrane are highly suggestive of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) with cholesteatoma. A high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone is the radiological investigation of choice for confirming and delineating the extent of cholesteatoma and bone erosion, which is crucial for surgical planning.

================================================================================
Question 237 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16-year-old patient came to the emergency outpatient department with ear discharge and hearing loss for 4 months. There was perforation in the posterosuperior quadrant of the tympanic membrane with mucopurulent discharge in the ear canal. The rest of the ENT examination was unremarkable. What is your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute suppurative otitis media
✓ CSOM with squamosal disease
  Otitis media with effusion
  CSOM with mucosal disease (Note: Correct option circled seems to be d)
  Otitis externa

Explanation:
A postero-superior marginal perforation of the tympanic membrane with chronic mucopurulent discharge and hearing loss is highly suggestive of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). Specifically, a posterior-superior marginal perforation is a strong indicator of cholesteatoma, which is associated with 'squamosal disease' (keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear space). While 'mucosal disease' refers to non-cholesteatomatous CSOM, the marginal perforation location makes 'squamosal disease' a much stronger probability.

================================================================================
Question 238 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 8-year-old female patient with hearing loss presented to the ENT OPD. On examination of the ear, the tympanic membrane was intact with a white shadow of mass in the anterosuperior quadrant of the tympanic membrane. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  acute otitis media
  CSOM with mucosal disease
✓ Congenital cholesteatoma
  Otitis media with effusion
  Tumor of the middle ear

Explanation:
The presence of hearing loss with an intact tympanic membrane and a white shadow of a mass in the anterosuperior quadrant is highly suggestive of a congenital cholesteatoma. Congenital cholesteatomas occur behind an intact tympanic membrane, typically in the anterior superior quadrant.

================================================================================
Question 239 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old teacher presented to the ENT OPD complaining of hoarseness of voice for three months. No improvement with medications. On examination of the larynx, there was a small lesion on the anterior 1/3rd of the left vocal cords. What is your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Chronic laryngitis
  Reinki's edema
  Vocal cord hemangioma
✓ Vocal cord nodule
  Chronic laryngitis

Explanation:
Persistent hoarseness of voice in a professional voice user (teacher), with no improvement with medications and the presence of a small lesion on the anterior one-third of the vocal cord, is highly suggestive of a vocal cord nodule ('singer's nodule' or 'teacher's nodule').

================================================================================
Question 240 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2-year-old male child presented to the emergency department with a barking cough, difficulty in breathing, malaise, and fever for 2 days. He was having biphasic stridor associated with cynosis and recession of the suprasternal and intercostal spaces. It was diagnosed as laryngotracheobronchitis. Which virus is most likely responsible for this disease?

Options:
  Parainfluenza type 11
✓ Parainfluenza type 1
  Respiratory syncytial virus type A
  Rispiratory syncytial virus type B
  Rhinovirus

Explanation:
Laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) is most commonly caused by parainfluenza viruses, with parainfluenza virus type 1 being the predominant cause.

================================================================================
Question 241 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient has a tumour of the parapharyngeal space with bulge in the oropharynx and laterally in the neck. The extent of parapharyngeal space is from the skull base up to:

Options:
  cricoid cartilage
  thyroid cartilage lower border
  hyoid
  D-Angle of mandible
✓ Superior mediastinum

Explanation:
The parapharyngeal space is a deep neck space that extends vertically from the base of the skull (specifically, the sphenoid bone) down to the hyoid bone, and effectively communicates inferiorly with the superior mediastinum.

================================================================================
Question 242 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old male presented with pain in the throat on the right side for 1 month. On examination, there was ulcerative lesions on right tonsil. A tonsillectomy has been done, and the histopathology report showed squamous cell carcinoma. What is the primary lymphatic drainage of this site?

Options:
  level III cervical lymph nodes
✓ level II cervical lymph nodes

Explanation:
The primary lymphatic drainage for the tonsils and oropharynx (including tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma) is predominantly to the ipsilateral Level II cervical lymph nodes (upper jugular nodes).

================================================================================
Question 243 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A post-thyroidectomy patient on her first post-operative day of surgery in the ENT ward complained of coughing while she was swallowing liquid. On examination both vocal cords were mobile. Which nerve is responsible for this condition?

Options:
  Recurrent laryngeal nerve
  External branch of Superior laryngeal nerve
✓ Internal branch of Superior laryngeal nerve
  Glossopharyngeal nerve
  Trigeminal nerve

Explanation:
Difficulty swallowing with coughing on liquids (aspiration), despite mobile vocal cords, suggests impaired sensation of the glottic and supraglottic regions. This is typically due to injury to the internal laryngeal nerve (a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve), which provides sensory innervation to these areas, leading to impaired cough reflex and aspiration.

================================================================================
Question 244 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12-year-old boy presented with anterior neck swelling for last one year. On examination, there was a small right thyroid lobe nodule on palpation, and FNAC shows suspicious for thyroid cancer. What thyroid malignancy is common in children?

Options:
  Follicular carcinoma
  Medullary CA
✓ Papillary CA
  anaplastic CA
  Squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation:
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is by far the most common type of thyroid malignancy in children and adolescents, typically having a good prognosis despite often presenting with lymph node metastases.

Question 245 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old female patient presented with a large parotid swelling for 2 years. There is also a bulge in the oral cavity, pushing the tonsil medially. Ultrasound features and FNAC is suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma. What is the surgical treatment plan?

Options:
  Superficial parotidectomy
✓ Total conservative parotidectomy
  Total radical parotidectomy
  Radiotherapy
  Chemotherapy

Explanation:
Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign parotid tumor. The surgical treatment of choice is total conservative parotidectomy (also known as total parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation). This involves removing the entire parotid gland (or at least the superficial and deep lobes as needed for complete tumor removal) while carefully preserving the facial nerve, due to the high recurrence rate of pleomorphic adenomas with incomplete excision.

================================================================================
Question 246 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Following tonsillectomy, a 17-year-old male complained of severe pain in the throat radiating towards left ear. Which nerve is responsible for post-tonsillectomy earache?

Options:
✓ IX
  X
  V
  VII
  XII

Explanation:
The glossopharyngeal nerve (Cranial Nerve IX) provides sensory innervation to both the tonsillar fossa and parts of the ear (via its tympanic branch). Therefore, irritation or inflammation in the tonsillar fossa after tonsillectomy can cause referred pain to the ear.

================================================================================
Question 247 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old woman underwent partial glossectomy and with selective neck dissection for a tongue tumor. What is the most common site for a tumour of the tongue?

Options:
  Dorsum
  Floor
  Ventral surface
✓ Lateral border
  Tip of the tongue

Explanation:
The lateral border (or lateral aspect) of the tongue, particularly the middle one-third, is the most common site for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue.

================================================================================
Question 248 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 9-year-old patient presented with complaints of regurgitation of fluid through the nose and denasal speech for the last 7 days. He had previously experienced an infection. What infection is responsible for this palatal palsy in this patient?

Options:
  Acute tonsillitis
  Infectious mononucleosis
✓ Diphtheria
  Vincents angina
  acute membraneous tonsillitis

Explanation:
Regurgitation of fluid through the nose and denasal speech (rhinolalia aperta) are signs of palatal palsy. This neurological complication, particularly following a pharyngeal infection, is highly characteristic of diphtheria, caused by the diphtheria toxin affecting nerve function.

================================================================================
Question 249 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old female presented to ENT complaining of dizziness for two days. It lasts for about 30 seconds and has no associated hearing loss. In episodic positional vertigo, which of the following test is used

Options:
  Caloric test
✓ Dix-hallpike manoeuvre
  Rotation test
  Electronystagmography
  Tympanometry

Explanation:
The description of brief, episodic dizziness (vertigo) triggered by positional changes, without associated hearing loss, is classic for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is the diagnostic test for BPPV, designed to provoke the vertigo and observe characteristic nystagmus.

================================================================================
Question 250 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42 years old female presented to ENT OPD with the history of progressive conductive hearing loss, also having pulsatile tinnitus and blood stained discharge. She also complains of headache, sweating and palpitations. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Acoustic neuroma
  Meniere's disease
✓ Glomus tumor
  Otosclerosis
  OME

Explanation:
Progressive conductive hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus (a whooshing or throbbing sound synchronized with the heartbeat), and blood-stained ear discharge, along with symptoms of catecholamine excess (headache, sweating, palpitations), are classic features of a glomus tumor (paraganglioma) of the middle ear or jugular bulb. These tumors are highly vascular and can secrete catecholamines.

================================================================================
Question 251 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 years old female presented with Slowly progressive conductive hearing loss with normal tympanic membrane and Eustachian tube function. What is the most probable clinical diagnosis.

Options:
  Otitis media with effusion
  Malingering
✓ Otosclerosis
  Tympanosclerosis
  Adhesive Otitis media

Explanation:
Slowly progressive conductive hearing loss, especially in a young or middle-aged female, with an otherwise normal tympanic membrane and Eustachian tube function, is highly suggestive of otosclerosis. This condition involves abnormal bone remodeling in the otic capsule, leading to fixation of the stapes footplate.

================================================================================
Question 252 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old woman in third trimester referred from obstetric OPD to ENT OPD with complaints of hearing her own sounds. Examination of the ear shows movements of tympanic membrane synchronous with respiration and especially exaggerated when nostril on the contralateral side is occluded. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Eustachian tube obstruction
  Otitis media with effusion
  Otosclerosis
✓ Patulous Eustachian tube
  CSOM

Explanation:
Autophony (hearing one's own voice or breathing sounds abnormally loudly), tympanic membrane movements synchronous with respiration (especially exaggerated with contralateral nostril occlusion), and often occurring during pregnancy, are classic signs of a patulous Eustachian tube. This condition involves an abnormally open Eustachian tube.

================================================================================
Question 253 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 years old boy has been diagnosed as cholesteatoma, on examination he is having postosuperior retracton pocket in left ear. All would constitute plan of management except:

Options:
  Audiometry
  Mastoid exploration
  Tympanoplasty
✓ Myringoplasty
  Atticotomy

Explanation:
Myringoplasty is the surgical repair of a tympanic membrane perforation without addressing middle ear disease. For a cholesteatoma, which is an aggressive epithelial cyst with bone erosion, a simple myringoplasty is inadequate. Management would typically include audiometry, mastoid exploration, tympanoplasty (to reconstruct the middle ear/TM after disease removal), and atticotomy (removal of the attic wall to access cholesteatoma).

================================================================================
Question 254 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male patient came with painful neck swelling and fever after the extraction of the first right lower molar five days earlier. On examination, there was swelling in the submental and submandibular regions, as well as drooling and trismus. He has difficulty in breathing for one day. What is your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Submandibular sialadentitis
  Submandibular sialolithiasis
  Quinsy
✓ Ludwig's angina
  Parotitis

Explanation:
The rapid onset of painful neck swelling (submental and submandibular regions), fever, drooling, trismus, and progressive difficulty breathing, all following a dental extraction, are classic signs of Ludwig's angina, a severe cellulitis of the floor of the mouth that can quickly compromise the airway.

================================================================================
Question 255 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
...vertigo on right side head movement, which last for less than one minute. There is no history of hearing loss or other neurological symptom. The patient also gives history of head trauma in the past. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Meniere's disease
  Vestibular neuronitis
✓ Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
  Epilepsy
  Vertebrobasilar insufficiency

Explanation:
Brief episodes of vertigo (lasting less than one minute) specifically triggered by head movements, without hearing loss or other neurological symptoms, are classic for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). A history of head trauma can be a predisposing factor.

================================================================================
Question 256 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12 years old female patient came to E.R with right ear foul smell, scanty discharge associated with headache., high grade fever with rigor & chills. On examination there was cholesteatoma in the right ear. Tenderness along with Internal Jugular vein, and oedema over the posterior part of mastoid. Which type of complication would you suspect in this patient?

Options:
  Mastoiditis
  Labyrinthitis
  Extradural abscess
✓ Lateral sinus thrombophlebitis
  Otitis hydrocephalus

Explanation:
The presence of cholesteatoma with high-grade fever, rigors, headache, and specific signs like tenderness along the internal jugular vein and edema over the posterior mastoid (Griesinger's sign) are classic indicators of lateral sinus thrombophlebitis, a serious intracranial complication of chronic otitis media.

================================================================================
Question 257 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Regarding the normal physiology of hearing, the sound waves are perceived by brain, which of the following structure is responsible for stimulation

Options:
  Basilar membrane
  Tectorial membrane
  Meissner's membrane
✓ Sensory hair cells of organ of corti
  VIII nerve

Explanation:
In the process of hearing, sound vibrations are converted into electrical signals by the sensory hair cells located within the Organ of Corti on the basilar membrane of the cochlea. These hair cells transduce mechanical energy into neural impulses that are then transmitted via the auditory nerve (VIII nerve) to the brain.

================================================================================
Question 258 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 19 years old female presented to ENT-OPD with right side facial paralysis, swelling of lips and fissured tongue. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Guillain - Barre syndrome
  Sarcoidosis
✓ Melkersson-rosenthal syndrome
  Bell's palsy
  Tumor

Explanation:
The triad of recurrent facial paralysis (right-sided), swelling of the lips (cheilitis granulomatosa), and fissured tongue is the classic presentation of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. It is a rare neurological disorder of unknown etiology.

================================================================================
Question 259 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A child was diagnosed with acute otitis media. After 14 days of antibiotic treatment there was subsidence of pain but persistence of deafness. The probable diagnosis is?

Options:
  Ototoxicity
  Acute otitis media
✓ Secretary otitis media
  Tympanosclerosis
  Otosclerosis

Explanation:
Persistence of deafness (hearing loss) after appropriate antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media, with subsidence of pain, is typical for secretory otitis media (SOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME). This condition involves the presence of fluid in the middle ear space without signs of acute infection, causing conductive hearing loss.

================================================================================
Question 260 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4 year-old child presented to ENT OPD with toxic appearance, painful swallowing, drooling of saliva, difficulty in breathing and with high grade fever 101F. On examination of the pharynx in the operation theatre in the presence of skilled Anesthetist, the throat and epiglottis was congested and the patient got relief with IV antibiotics, Racemic Epinephrine Nebulization, IV steroid and Hydration and O2 inhalation. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute laryngitis
  Acute tracheitis
  Acute pharyngitis
✓ Acute Epiglottis
  Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis

Explanation:
The rapid onset of high fever, toxic appearance, painful swallowing, drooling, and difficulty breathing (stridor), along with a congested epiglottis seen in the OR, are classic signs of acute epiglottitis. The response to supportive care and steroids is also consistent.

================================================================================
Question 261 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 year- old male, motor mechanic profession presented to ENT Out Patient Department with Hoarseness of voice for 4 months. He is chain smoker for the last 20 years. On Examination, a reddish area of mucosal irregularity over the surface of Right vocal cord. In management of such a patient what will be your first step for diagnosis?

Options:
  Cessation of smoking
  Right cordectomy
✓ Direct laryngoscopy and Biopsy
  CT scan of NECK
  Regular Follow up

Explanation:
A chronic smoker with persistent hoarseness and a reddish area of mucosal irregularity on the vocal cord has a high suspicion for laryngeal carcinoma or a precancerous lesion. The first and most critical step for diagnosis is direct laryngoscopy with biopsy to obtain tissue for histopathological examination.

================================================================================
Question 262 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2 year-old child came to Emergency department with difficulty in breathing and later, he was diagnosed as a case of Juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis. Which organism is responsible for this condition of the patient?

Options:
  Hemophilus Influenzae
✓ Human Papilloma virus
  Adenovirus
  Ebstein Barr Virus
  Herpes Simplex Virus

Explanation:
Juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis (recurrent respiratory papillomatosis) is caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, primarily types 6 and 11, typically acquired perinatally from an infected mother.

================================================================================
Question 263 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year-old tracheostomized patient in the ward was suffered from sudden blockage of the Portex Tracheostomy tube and was having difficulty in breathing. What will be your first step in management of such a patient?

Options:
  Suction clearance of the tube
  Humidified O2 inhalation
  Racemic Epinephrine Nebulization
  Use of Soda Bicarbonate and suction clearance
✓ Immediate removal of the tracheostomy tube

Explanation:
In a tracheostomized patient with sudden, complete tracheostomy tube blockage and difficulty breathing, immediate removal of the tube is the most critical first step. This re-establishes an airway, allowing for reinsertion of a new tube or other airway management. Attempts at suctioning might dislodge the obstruction further down or be insufficient.

================================================================================
Question 264 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 3 year-old child presented to ENT Emergency department with history of coughing, choking and gagging for the last 2 days. On auscultation, his breathing sounds were reduced on right side of chest and there was unilateral wheeze on the same side. On Xray chest, there was right hyper inflated chest shadow with trachea deviated to the opposite side. What is your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute Bronchiolitis
  Acute Bronchial Asthma
  Bronchiectasis
✓ Foreign Body in the Right Bronchus
  Acute respiratory Distress syndrome

Explanation:
The acute onset of coughing, choking, and gagging, followed by unilateral reduced breath sounds, unilateral wheeze, hyperinflated chest, and tracheal deviation on X-ray in a child, are classic signs of a foreign body lodged in the right bronchus, causing a check-valve obstruction (air trapping).

================================================================================
Question 265 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year-old singer developed hoarseness of voice for the last 2 months. On laryngoscopic examination small nodules were observed on both vocal cords. Treatment of choice for this condition is;

Options:
  Antibiotics
  Wait and see
✓ Speech therapy
  Microlaryngoscopic excision & Speech therapy
  Microlaryngoscopic excision

Explanation:
Vocal cord nodules ('singer's nodules') are benign lesions caused by vocal abuse. For persistent nodules in a professional voice user, speech therapy (voice therapy) is the first-line and most effective treatment. Surgical excision is reserved for cases that fail conservative management.

================================================================================
Question 266 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 3-year-old child presented to Emergency department with stridor for one day. On posterio-anterior view of X-ray neck, there was a steeple sign? What will be your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis
  Diphtheric Laryngitis
✓ Juvenile Laryngeal papillomatosis

Explanation:
A steeple sign on a posterior-anterior view of an X-ray neck is a classic radiological finding for acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), indicating subglottic narrowing due to inflammation.

================================================================================
Question 267 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 year-old trumpet Blower presented with Hoarseness of voice for the last 2 months. He was also having cough intermittently. On examination of the Neck, He was having swelling on Right side of the Neck, which is reducible on valsalva manoeuvre. What is your most likely Diagnosis?

Options:
  Laryngeal Trauma
  Laryngeal Tumor
  Cervical Lymph adenopathy
  Thyroglossal cyst
✓ Laryngocele

Explanation:
A reducible neck swelling that increases with Valsalva maneuver (e.g., coughing, playing a wind instrument like a trumpet) and is associated with hoarseness is a classic presentation of a laryngocele, which is an abnormal air-filled sac in the larynx.

================================================================================
Question 268 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old patient had hoarseness of voice and coughing on fluid intake for three months. On endoscopic examination, the right vocal cord was in the cadaveric position. Which nerves are involved in this condition?

Options:
  Right superior Laryngeal nerve
  Right internal laryngeal branch of superior laryngeal nerve
  Right recurrent laryngeal nerve of vagus nerve
✓ Recurrent and superior laryngeal branches of vagus nerve
  Non recurrent laryngeal nerve

Explanation:
A vocal cord in the 'cadaveric' position (intermediate position) with hoarseness and coughing on fluid intake (aspiration) suggests complete paralysis of the vocal cord. This involves damage to both the recurrent laryngeal nerve (affecting all intrinsic laryngeal muscles except cricothyroid) and the superior laryngeal nerve (affecting cricothyroid and laryngeal sensation), as both contribute to vocal cord function and protection.

================================================================================
Question 269 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 years old child came to the ENT department with respiratory stridor, difficulty in breathing, odynophagia, drooling of saliva and high grade 101F temperature. He was diagnosed as a case of Acute Epiglottitis? Which organism is responsible in causation this disease?

Options:
  Streptococcus Pneumoniae
  Streptococcus Pyogens
✓ H.Influenzae Type B
  Morexella Catarrhalis
  E-Coli

Explanation:
*Haemophilus influenzae* type B (Hib) was historically the primary causative organism for acute epiglottitis. Although its incidence has significantly decreased due to widespread vaccination, it remains a common answer in the context of causative organisms for this condition.

================================================================================
Question 270 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old male patient is having right sided infra auricular swelling for the last 5 years. On examination he is having right parotid swelling that is firm, mobile, with no skin changes and intact facial nerve. What is the most common tumor in parotid gland?

Options:
  Adenoid cystic carcinoma
  Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
  Warthin's tumor
✓ Pleomorphic adenoma
  Sq. Cell carcinoma

Explanation:
A slowly growing, firm, mobile, non-tender infra-auricular (parotid) swelling, with intact facial nerve function, for several years, is classic for a pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumor), which is the most common benign tumor of the parotid gland.

================================================================================
Question 271 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old female patient is complaining of toothache for the last 5 days. Now she is complaining of swelling in the neck for 2 days. On examination she has swelling in both the submandibular and submaxillary areas that is red and tender to touch. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute laryngitis
  Peritonsillar abscess
✓ Ludwig's angina
  Parotid abscess
  Ranula

Explanation:
A rapidly progressive painful neck swelling in the submandibular and submental regions, often originating from a dental infection (toothache), along with redness and tenderness, are hallmark signs of Ludwig's angina, a severe cellulitis of the floor of the mouth that can compromise the airway.

================================================================================
Question 272 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old female patient is complaining of bilateral progressive hearing loss with no history of ear discharge or trauma. On examination she is having bilateral intact TMs. On PTA she is having conductive hearing loss. What type of tympanogram she will have?

Options:
  Ad
✓ As
  A
  B
  C

Explanation:
Bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss with intact tympanic membranes and a normal Eustachian tube function is highly suggestive of otosclerosis. In otosclerosis, the stapes footplate becomes fixed, leading to reduced compliance of the middle ear system, which results in a Type As tympanogram (shallow, stiff curve).

================================================================================
Question 273 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years old male patient presented with 2 days history of bilateral nasal obstruction, after trauma to his face. Examination reveals smooth rounded swelling of the septum in both nasal fossae that is soft & fluctuant. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  DNS
  Ac polyps
✓ Septal hematoma
  Choanal atresia
  Septal perforation

Explanation:
Bilateral, smooth, rounded, soft, and fluctuant swelling of the nasal septum following facial trauma is the classic presentation of a septal hematoma. This is a collection of blood under the perichondrium of the nasal septum and requires urgent drainage to prevent complications.

================================================================================
Question 274 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 years old female patient presented with bleeding from right side of the nose for last 2 days. On examination she was having raw area on the right septum. What is the most common site of epistaxis?

Options:
  Middle turbinate
  Inferior turbinate
✓ Little's area
  Posterior septum
  Diffuse

Explanation:
Little's area (or Kiesselbach's plexus) on the anterior nasal septum is the most common site of epistaxis (nosebleeds), especially in younger individuals. It is a vascular watershed area prone to trauma and dryness, leading to bleeding.

================================================================================
Question 275 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10 years old boy known presented to ENT OPD with severe pain in the right ear since yesterday. He was also complaining of flu for last one week. On examination of right ear he has reddish tympanic membrane and normal meatal skin. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Bell's palsy
  Otitis externa hemorrhagica
  Herpes zoster oticus
  Malignant otitis externa
✓ Acute Otitis media (Highlighted, though reddish TM/flu often implies Bullous Myringitis)

Explanation:
The severe ear pain, recent flu-like illness, and a reddish, bulging tympanic membrane with normal meatal skin are classic signs of acute otitis media (AOM). The preceding flu suggests a viral upper respiratory infection, which is a common precursor to AOM.

================================================================================
Question 276 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male presented to ENT OPD with history of discharge in the right ear for 5 years, on ear examination he has debris in the superior quadrant of tympanic membrane surrounded by granulations along with scanty discharge in the meatus. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Malignancy
✓ Cholestetoma
  Foreign body
  Otitis externa
  Otomycosis

Explanation:
A long history of ear discharge (5 years), with debris and granulations in the superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane (attic region), is highly indicative of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma is a destructive epithelial cyst that can erode bone and cause chronic discharge.

================================================================================
Question 277 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 7 years male child presented to ENT OPD with foul smelling discharge from right nostril. On examination diagnosis of rhinolith was confirmed. what is the best treatment of choice for rhinolith?

Options:
  Antibiotics
  Steroids
✓ Endoscopic surgery
  Caldwell-luc operation
  Intranasal polypectomy (Note: highlighted answer E is medically unusual for rhinolith, usually just removal. Arrow points towards C as well)

Explanation:
For a rhinolith (a calcified foreign body in the nasal cavity), the definitive treatment of choice is removal. This is typically achieved through endoscopic surgery, which allows for precise visualization and safe extraction of the foreign body.

================================================================================

================================================================================
Question 279 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
...soft palate shows inflammation with bullous eruptions. Taste sensations over the Left side of tongue are absent. Tuning fork test shows the Weber lateralizing to the Left ear. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Options:
  Bullous Myringitis
  Diffuse otitis externa
  Herpangina
✓ Ramsay- Hunt Syndrome
  Steven-Johnson Syndrome

Explanation:
The presence of vesicles/bullous eruptions on the soft palate, altered taste sensation on the left side of the tongue, and Weber lateralizing to the left ear (suggesting left-sided sensorineural hearing loss or significant conductive loss) along with ear symptoms from the previous question, are all features that can coalesce into a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus), which affects cranial nerves VII and VIII, and sometimes IX and X.

================================================================================
Question 280 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6 months old male child was brought to ENT OPD with history of stridor. Stridor increases with crying but subsides on placing the child in prone position and his cry is normal. Direct laryngoscopy shows an omega shaped epiglottis. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Subglottic stenosis
  Laryngeal web
  Vocal cord palsy
✓ Laryngomalacia
  acute epiglottitis

Explanation:
The stridor that increases with crying (increased airflow velocity) but improves in the prone position (gravity pulls supraglottic structures forward), a normal cry, and the laryngoscopic finding of an omega-shaped epiglottis are classic diagnostic features of laryngomalacia, the most common cause of congenital stridor.

================================================================================
Question 281 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 3 year old child has put a button battery in the nose 6 hours back. He is now having nasal obstruction and nasal discharge. On examination; anterior rhinoscopy revealed no foreign body. The left nostril shows reduced patency on cold spatula test.. X-ray nose AP and lateral views confirms the presence of foreign body. While you are working in a tertiary care hospital, what is the preferred choice for removal of this foreign body?

Options:
  Wrap the child in a towel and remove with hook.
  Wrap the child in a towel and remove with nook and endoscope
  Remove with hook under rigid endoscopic control under LA
  Intubate the child and remove using blunt hook under GA
✓ Intubate the child and remove using endoscope under GA

Explanation:
A button battery in the nose is a medical emergency due to the rapid liquefaction necrosis it can cause. Given the child's age, the need for complete and atraumatic removal of a potentially corrosive foreign body, and the presence in a tertiary care hospital, intubation of the child and removal using an endoscope under general anesthesia (GA) is the preferred and safest choice. This allows for controlled removal, prevents aspiration, and permits thorough inspection for damage.

================================================================================
Question 282 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 year old girl presented with sore throat, foreign body sensation and occasional episodes of hoarseness for the past 3 years. The symptoms get worse whenever she has to appear in exams. On examination; The tonsillar area and posterior pharyngeal wall are congested. Endoscopic direct laryngoscopy shows no pooling of saliva, congested but mobile vocal cords with signs of acute inflammation in the interarytenoid area. X-ray neck lateral view shows normal soft tissue density. Her Hb level is 12.4 gm% and white cells count is normal. What is the most probable diagnosis.

Options:
  Acute laryngitis.
  Globus Pharyngis
  Plummer- Vinson's syndrome
✓ Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
  Intubation granuloma

Explanation:
The chronic symptoms of sore throat, foreign body sensation ('globus sensation'), hoarseness, and exacerbation during stress (exams) are highly suggestive of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), which is often a manifestation of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The signs of inflammation in the interarytenoid area on laryngoscopy further support this, as this region is particularly sensitive to refluxate.

================================================================================

Options:
  Bullous Myringitis
  Diffuse otitis externa
  Herpangina
✓ Ramsay- Hunt Syndrome
  Steven-Johnson Syndrome

Explanation:
The symptoms of fever, severe ear pain, difficulty swallowing, altered taste, inflammation of the pinna, external auditory canal, and tympanic membrane, along with soft palate inflammation, strongly point to Ramsay Hunt syndrome. This condition involves reactivation of varicella-zoster virus affecting the geniculate ganglion, leading to facial palsy and herpetic eruptions in the ear and oral cavity, often with associated taste disturbance.

================================================================================
Question 284 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old male patient is having left-sided facial weakness and vesicles around his left ear for the last 2 days. He was diagnosed as Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Which of the following ganglion is involved in this condition?

Options:
  Scarpa's
  Spiral
✓ Geniculate
  Stellate
  Cervical

Explanation:
Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy) results from the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion, which is a sensory ganglion of the facial nerve (CN VII).

Question 286 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old male patient has complained of nasal obstruction for the last 7 years despite the continuous use of a nasal spray. Which of the following drug is linked with rhinitis medicamentosa?

Options:
  Inranasal steroid spray
  Ipratropium bromide
✓ Xylometazoline
  Cocaine
  Antihistamine

Explanation:
Rhinitis medicamentosa is a condition of rebound nasal congestion caused by the overuse of topical decongestant nasal sprays. Xylometazoline is a common topical decongestant that, with prolonged use, leads to this condition.

================================================================================
Question 287 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4-year-old child complains of bleeding and a foul odour from the right side of his nose. He also experiences purulent discharge on the same side. The likely diagnosis is:

Options:
  Septal deviation with right maxillary sinusitis
  Unilateral choanal atresia
  Antrochoanal polyp
✓ Nasal Foreign body
  Hematoma

Explanation:
Unilateral nasal obstruction, foul-smelling discharge (often purulent), and occasional bleeding in a child are classic symptoms of a retained nasal foreign body, which typically causes inflammation and secondary infection.

================================================================================
Question 288 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
During Thyroidectomy, care should be taken to preserve the superior laryngeal nerve along with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Which of the following muscle is innervated by superior laryngeal nerve?

Options:
✓ Cricothyroid
  Lateral Cricoarytenoid
  Posterior cricoarytenoid
  Transverse arytenoids
  Inter arytenoids

Explanation:
The superior laryngeal nerve (specifically its external branch) innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for tensing and elongating the vocal cords, thereby controlling pitch. The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates all other intrinsic laryngeal muscles.

================================================================================
Question 289 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old male patient presented with palpable nodes in the right posterior triangle of the neck. In addition, he has right-sided nasal obstruction and ear fullness. FNAC of the node is suggestive of metastatic disease. Likelihood... nodal metastasis to the posterior triangle of the neck is from:

Options:
  Buccal mucosa
  Hard palate
  Paranasal sinuses
✓ Nasopharynx
  Glottis

Explanation:
Metastatic lymph nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck, especially when associated with symptoms like nasal obstruction and ear fullness (suggesting Eustachian tube dysfunction), are highly suspicious for a primary tumor in the nasopharynx (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma frequently metastasizes to the upper cervical lymph nodes, including the posterior triangle.

================================================================================
Question 290 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old male patient presented with a history of recurrent epistaxis for last one month. On nasal examination a reddish mass was visible. Biopsy of the mass confirmed Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Which of the paranasal sinus is most commonly involved in malignancy?

Options:
✓ Maxillary
  Anterior Ethmoid
  Frontal
  Sphenoid
  Posterior Ethmoid

Explanation:
The maxillary sinus is the paranasal sinus most commonly involved in malignancies, particularly squamous cell carcinoma. Symptoms can include recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction, and facial pain/swelling.

================================================================================
Question 291 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young male patient came to ENT-OPD with ear pain, fever, and hearing loss for one week. On examination, the tympanic membrane was congested with pulsatile otorrhea. This is usually seen in:

Options:
  Glomus tumour
  CSF otorrhea
✓ Acute Suppurative otitis media
  Fistula
  CSOM

Explanation:
Pulsatile otorrhea (ear discharge that pulsates) with a congested tympanic membrane, ear pain, fever, and hearing loss, suggests a vigorous inflammatory process in the middle ear, such as acute suppurative otitis media (AOM) or an exacerbation of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). While glomus tumors can cause pulsatile tinnitus, the context of an acute inflammatory presentation points more towards AOM or CSOM.

================================================================================
Question 292 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old male patient is diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx with involvement of the thyroid cartilage, and it is staged as T4N0M0. What will be the best treatment?

Options:
  Radiotherapy
  Chemotherapy
  Total laryngectomy
✓ Total laryngectomy with radiotherapy
  Neck dissection

Explanation:
For advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with involvement of the thyroid cartilage (T4 stage), the best treatment typically involves a combination of total laryngectomy (surgical removal of the larynx) and adjuvant radiotherapy, often with or without chemotherapy. This aggressive approach aims for curative intent and addresses local and regional disease spread.

================================================================================
Question 293 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An adult male patient presented to the ENT department with nasal obstruction and unilateral conductive hearing loss. A nasal swab showed Ebstein-Barr virus in the report. Which of the following tumors is related to this virus?

Options:
  Carcinoma of tongue
✓ Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
  Postcricoid growth
  Parotid tumour
  Supraglottic tumours

Explanation:
The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is strongly associated with the etiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), particularly the undifferentiated type. The symptoms of nasal obstruction and unilateral conductive hearing loss (due to Eustachian tube obstruction) are common presentations of NPC.

================================================================================
Question 294 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old woman was referred from the Obstetric Department to the Ear, Nose and Throat Department with a history of bleeding from the oral cavity; on examination, she has a soft, smooth, reddish to purple mass on the anterior dorsum of the tongue that bleeds on touch. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Hemangioma
  Papilloma
✓ Pyogenic granuloma
  Fibroepithelial polyp
  Granular cell myoblastoma

Explanation:
A soft, smooth, reddish to purple mass on the tongue that bleeds easily on touch, particularly in a pregnant woman (or due to hormonal changes), is highly suggestive of a pyogenic granuloma (also known as a lobular capillary hemangioma). These lesions are benign and vascular, often growing rapidly.

================================================================================
Question 295 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 17-year-old boy visited the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department with a history of persistent nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis for the last 5 months. To exclude angiofibroma, What will be the investigation of choice?

Options:
  Carotid angiography
✓ CT Scan of nose and paranasal sinuses with contrast
  MRI of nose and paranasal sinuses
  Xray Paranasal sinuses
  Xray neck lateral view

Explanation:
In an adolescent male with persistent nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis, juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) should be suspected. A CT scan of the nose and paranasal sinuses with contrast is the investigation of choice for initial diagnosis, to define the tumor's extent, and assess its vascularity. Angiography may be used for embolization, but CT is for initial diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 296 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old man gives a history of unilateral clear discharge from the nose for the last 6 months, which increases on bending the head forward. He had history of road traffic accident and remained unconscious for some time. To rule out CSF rhinorrhea, Which of the following laboratory test is specifically recommended?

Options:
  CSF sugar
  Serum electrolytes
  Serum albumin
✓ B2 transferin
  Blood sugar

Explanation:
Unilateral clear nasal discharge, especially increasing on bending forward and following head trauma, is highly suspicious for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. The most specific laboratory test to confirm CSF rhinorrhea is the detection of beta-2 transferrin (or beta-trace protein) in the nasal discharge, as these are uniquely found in CSF.

================================================================================
Question 297 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An adult patient presented with a painful swelling at the tip of his nose and fever for two days. On examination, the nasal vestibule was erythematous and tender to touch. The condition was diagnosed as nasal furunculosis? Which one of the following pathogen is involved in this condition?

Options:
  streptococcus viridans
✓ Staphylococcus aureus
  Pneumococcus
  E coli.
  B proteus.

Explanation:
Nasal furunculosis (a painful boil or abscess in the nasal vestibule) is almost always caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*, which is a common commensal on the skin and in the anterior nares. The painful swelling, erythema, and tenderness are characteristic.

================================================================================
Question 298 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male patient had recurrent attacks of pain in the right ear with blockage for 8 weeks. It was diagnosed as right chronic otitis externa. Which of the following organisms is responsible for this disease?

Options:
✓ Pseudomonas Aeruginosa
  Staph Aureus
  Morexella Cattarhalis
  Bacteriods
  H. Influenza

Explanation:
*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a common causative organism for chronic otitis externa, especially in cases that are recurrent or associated with moisture/swimming. *Staphylococcus aureus* is also frequent, but *Pseudomonas* is a very typical cause of chronic/recalcitrant OE.

================================================================================
Question 299 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old female patient presented with bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. On otoscopic examination, there was a reddish blush or sun rising appearance on the promontory, and on a pure tone audiogram, there was bilateral mild conductive hearing loss with a dip at the 2000 Hz frequency. What is your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Otitis media with effusion
  Otitis media
  Cholesterol granuloma
✓ Otosclerosis
  Meniere's disease

Explanation:
Bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss, an intact tympanic membrane, and the classic 'reddish blush' or 'sunrise appearance' (Schwartze's sign) on the promontory are pathognomonic for otosclerosis. The dip at 2000 Hz (Carhart's notch) is also characteristic of otosclerosis, reflecting a bone conduction artifact.

================================================================================
Question 300 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A male adult patient came with complaints of swelling in front of the left ear for 2 months. On examination, it was non tender, mobile, firm in consistency, and without facial palsy. The rest of the neck examination was unremarkable. What is your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Hemangioma of the parotid
  Lipoma
  Warthin tumor
  Parotid cyst
✓ pleomorphic adenoma

Explanation:
A slowly growing, non-tender, mobile, firm swelling in front of the ear (parotid region), without facial nerve involvement, is the classic presentation of a pleomorphic adenoma, which is the most common benign tumor of the parotid gland.

================================================================================
Question 301 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old male presented to ENT ER with upper neck swelling bilaterally and difficulty in breathing for 1 week. In examination there was a bulge in floor of mouth and it was diagnosed with Ludwig’s angina. Infection of which space?

Options:
  buccal space
  parotid space
✓ submandibular space
  diagastric space
  buccinator space

Explanation:
Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening cellulitis of the floor of the mouth, involving the submandibular, submental, and sublingual spaces. It causes bilateral neck swelling and elevation of the tongue (bulge in floor of mouth).

================================================================================
Question 302 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
5-year-old child presented to OPD with hoarseness of voice, difficulty in breathing and inspiratory stridor. Diagnosed with juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis. Most common virus?

  Acoustic Neuroma
  Labyrinthitis

Explanation:
The classic triad of Meniere's disease consists of episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus (often with aural fullness).

================================================================================
Question 304 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Pleomorphic adenoma: right treatment of choice?

Options:
  Enucleation
✓ Superficial parotidectomy
  Total parotidectomy
  Radiotherapy
  Chemotherapy

Explanation:
The standard treatment for pleomorphic adenoma is superficial parotidectomy. Simple enucleation is contraindicated due to the high risk of recurrence caused by microscopic extensions of the tumor through its pseudocapsule.

================================================================================
Question 305 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
4-year-old child with repeated attacks of chest infection; last attack unresolved. Opacified lower lobe, no air entry. Most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Bronchiolitis
  Asthma
✓ Foreign body inhalation
  Lower respiratory tract infection
  Pneumothorax

Explanation:
In a young child, recurrent unilateral pneumonia or unresolved lobar opacity with decreased air entry is highly suggestive of an aspirated foreign body causing bronchial obstruction.

================================================================================
Question 306 (KGMC - 2025)

Bilateral choanal atresia presents at birth with cyclical cyanosis (blue when feeding/quiet, pink when crying). Because neonates are obligate nose breathers, this is an emergency. McGovern’s nipple helps maintain an oral airway.

================================================================================
Question 308 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
30-year-old lady with pleomorphic adenoma removed via superficial parotidectomy. Weeks later sweating around right face while eating. Diagnosis?

Options:
  food allergy
✓ Frey's syndrome
  general hyperhidrosis
  compensatory hyperhidrosis
  gustatory sweating

Explanation:
Frey's syndrome (gustatory sweating) is a complication of parotidectomy where regenerating parasympathetic fibers (secretomotor to saliva glands) aberrantly innervate the sweat glands of the overlying skin.

================================================================================
Question 309 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
60-year-old patient with SCC larynx, thyroid cartilage involved, T4N0M0. Best treatment?

✓ Atrophic Rhinitis (Ozaena)
  Rhinitis sicca
  Syphilitic rhinitis
  Foreign body

Explanation:
Atrophic rhinitis (Ozaena) is characterized by progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa and bone. Despite a roomy cavity, patients complain of obstruction (loss of sensation) and foul smell (cacosmia/ozena).

================================================================================
Question 353 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5-year-old child presents with a fever, sore throat, and a greyish-white membrane over the tonsils that bleeds on attempted removal. Diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute follicular tonsillitis
  Infectious mononucleosis
✓ Diphtheria
  Vincent's angina
  Candidiasis

Explanation:
The hallmark of Diphtheria is a tough, greyish pseudomembrane on the tonsils/pharynx. Attempting to remove it causes bleeding. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

================================================================================
Question 354 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which audiological test is best used to confirm the presence of recruitment in Meniere’s disease?

Options:
  Tone decay test
✓ Short Increment Sensitivity Index (SISI)
  Rinne test
  Bing test
  Stenger test

Explanation:
Recruitment (abnormal growth of loudness) is a feature of cochlear pathology like Meniere's. The SISI test measures the ability to detect small changes in intensity; a high score indicates recruitment.

================================================================================
Question 355 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

This clinical picture suggests Orbital Cellulitis (likely post-septal) with optic nerve compression (RAPD). The immediate priority is high-dose IV antibiotics to prevent intracranial spread and permanent vision loss.

================================================================================
Question 360 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 year old patient has presented to OPD with foul smell discharge from right ear, and decreased hearing level for the last 7 years. On otoscopic examination Cholesteatoma is seen in the attic region as pearl white materials. CT scan shows hypodense opacity in the right mastoid antrum, What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Acute Suppurative Otitis Media
✓ Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media
  Otosclerosis
  Secretory otitis media
  Tympanosclerosis

Explanation:
The long history of foul-smelling ear discharge and decreased hearing, along with the presence of cholesteatoma (pearl-white material in the attic region) and mastoid opacity on CT, are classic signs of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) with cholesteatoma.

================================================================================
Question 361 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old patient has presented to a consultant clinic for complaining of right ear discharge, swelling and pain for last 20 days. The consultant notices a swelling and labeled it as an extracranial complication of choronic supportive otitis media along the sterocleidomastoid muscle. CT Scans shows erosion of the bone at sinodural angle. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
✓ Bezolds Abscess
  Citile abscess
  Lucs abscesses
  Mastoid abscesses
  Zygomatic abscesses

Explanation:
The description of an extracranial complication of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) presenting as a swelling and pain along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, with bone erosion in the mastoid, is characteristic of a Bezold's abscess. This occurs when infection from the mastoid tip erodes through the bone and tracks into the neck.

================================================================================
Question 362 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12 years old patient has presented to Emergency Room complaining of Fever & rigors for the last 4 days. He is also a diagnosed case of cholesteatoma left ear. The consultant advised a Magnetic Resonance Venography to show venous flow and PTA shows mixed hearing loss. What is the most likely clinical diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Acute mastoiditis
  Acute pyogenic meningitis
  Cerebellar abscess
✓ Lateral sinus thrombosis
  Otitic hydrocephalus

Explanation:
Cholesteatoma (a complication of CSOM) with persistent fever and rigors, along with mixed hearing loss and the use of MRV to assess venous flow, strongly points to lateral sinus thrombosis, a serious intracranial complication where a blood clot forms in the dural venous sinus due to adjacent infection.

================================================================================
Question 363 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 11 years old boy was brought to emergency room by his mother complaining of unilateral sore throat, headache and difficulty in mouth opening for the last 7 days. On examination a palpable swelling is noticed at level-2 behind angle of the jaw and on oral cavity examination, swelling has extension posterior to the posterior pillar of the tonsil on same side. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Unilateral tonsillitis
  Peritonsillar abscesses
✓ Parapharyngeal abscesses
  Pleomorphic adenoma
  Retropharyngeal abscesses

Explanation:
The symptoms of unilateral sore throat, headache, difficulty in mouth opening (trismus), palpable swelling behind the angle of the jaw, and swelling extending posterior to the posterior pillar of the tonsil are classic for a parapharyngeal abscess. Peritonsillar abscesses typically deviate the tonsil medially and anteriorly.

================================================================================
Question 364 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 year old man was brought to the emergency room complaining of hoarseness of voice for the last 7 months that is progressive and now having difficulty in breathing for the last three days. He is giving history of Carcinoma Larynx for which he received radiation. Flexible laryngoscopy shows fixed vocal cords with ulcerated growth and CT Scan shows heterogeneously enhancing lesion involving vocal cords and thyroid cartilage. What is the most appropriate T-stage classification for this patient?

Options:
  T0
  T1
  T2
  T3
✓ T4b

Explanation:
For laryngeal carcinoma, vocal cord fixation places the tumor at least at T3. Involvement of the thyroid cartilage or extension beyond the larynx classifies it as T4. T4b indicates invasion of the prevertebral space, encasement of the carotid artery, or invasion of mediastinal structures, signifying very advanced disease. Given the comprehensive involvement described, T4b is the most appropriate classification among the options, signifying extensive disease.

================================================================================
Question 365 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old man has brought to the emergency room complaining of hoarseness of voice for the last 14 months that is progressive and now having difficulty in breathing for the last two days. He is giving history of Carcinoma Larynx for which he received radiation. The patient has developed decrease saturation for which intervention is needed. What is the best airway management option in this case?

Options:
  EndoTracheal Intubation
✓ Tracheostomy between ring two and three of trachea
  Low Tracheostomy
  Percutaneous Tracheostomy
  High Tracheostomy

Explanation:
In a patient with severe airway obstruction due to advanced laryngeal carcinoma (especially recurrent after radiation), with decreasing oxygen saturation, establishing a surgical airway is crucial. Tracheostomy between the second and third tracheal rings is the standard and safest site for this procedure, bypassing the obstruction in the larynx.

================================================================================
Question 366 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old man has presented to specialist outpatient complaining of painful swallowing, hoarseness of voice and sometimes regurgitation of food for the last 8 months. Examination of the neck and indirect laryngoscopy are unremarkable. His Hb level is 9.8g/dl, Total leucocyte count 15000mcl. Repeated Water soluble Barium swallow shows a constant filling on the side of the neck. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Laryngocele
  Oesopheageal carcinoma
✓ Pharyngeal pouch
  Piriform sinus carcinoma
  Postcricoid carcinoma

Explanation:
The symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, and hoarseness (often due to aspiration), combined with a classic 'constant filling' on the side of the neck on barium swallow, are highly indicative of a pharyngeal pouch (Zenker's diverticulum).

================================================================================
Question 367 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 year old patient is brought to consultant clinic by his parents complaining of pain in his right ear of sudden onset of three hours duration. Otoscopy shows red congested Tympanic membrane with bulge in the centre and the patient is febrile too. What is the most likely route of spread of infection in this case?

Options:
  Direct spread from external ear
  Haematogenous spread
  Infection of the Para Nasal Sinus is
  Patulous Eustachian Tube
✓ Shorter and wider Eustachian Tube s

Explanation:
The clinical picture describes acute otitis media (AOM) in a child. In children, AOM typically results from the spread of infection from the nasopharynx to the middle ear via the Eustachian tube. Their Eustachian tubes are anatomically shorter, wider, and more horizontal, making them more prone to dysfunction and infection.

================================================================================
Question 368 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 years old patient has presented to outpatient department complaining of change in voice for the last 3 months that is persistent and progressive in nature. Her Flexible Endoscopy shows a fungating. ulcerative lesion involving anterior one third of the right vocal cord, but both vocal cords are mobile. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Arytenoid granuloma
  Cord papilloma
✓ Squamous cell carcinoma
  Vocal cord nodule
  Vocal cord polyp

Explanation:
A persistent and progressive change in voice associated with a fungating, ulcerative lesion on the vocal cord, even with normal vocal cord mobility (suggesting an early stage), is highly suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. Biopsy would be required for definitive diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 369 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 19 years old patient was diagnosed as a case of Gradinigo syndrome due Chronic Supporative Otitis media 7 days ago. On examination, the postaural area is tender with scanty foul smelling discharge from the left ear. Pure tone audiometry shows mixed hearing loss. What is the most likely cause responsible for this condition?

Options:
  Acute mastoid abscess
✓ Acute petrositis
  Chronic otitis media.
  Lucus abscesses
  Secretory otitis media

Explanation:
Gradenigo's syndrome is a known complication of petrositis (inflammation of the petrous apex of the temporal bone), which in turn results from chronic suppurative otitis media. The triad of otitis media, pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution, and ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy defines Gradenigo's.

================================================================================
Question 370 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 24 year old patient has history of foul smell discharge from right ear for the last 7 years. On examination he has attic defect and granulation tissue. For the last 7 days, he has developed a triad of ear discharge, retro-orbital pain and 6th nerve paralysis. Audiometry showed profound hearing loss. What is the most likely cause in this patient?

Options:
  Cavernous sinus thrombosis
  Lateral sinus thrombosis
  Labyrinthitis
  Mastoiditis
✓ Petrositis

Explanation:
The triad of chronic ear discharge (from CSOM/cholesteatoma), retro-orbital pain (trigeminal neuralgia), and 6th nerve (abducens) paralysis constitutes Gradenigo's syndrome, which is caused by inflammation of the petrous apex of the temporal bone, i.e., petrositis.

================================================================================
Question 371 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 17-year-old patient has presented to outpatient complaining of right pain for the last 3 days. On otoscopic examination the tympanic membrane is red congested. The patient received oral antibiotics and nasal sprays but not relieved. Most effective treatment option in this patient to avoid complication is

Options:
  Intravenous Venous Antibiotics
  Nasal topical steroids
✓ Myringotomy with grommet insertion
  Tympanocentesis in anterior superior quadrant
  Tympanocentesis in anterior inferior quadrant

Explanation:
For persistent or refractory acute otitis media (AOM) with a red, bulging tympanic membrane, especially when pain is not relieved by antibiotics, myringotomy (incision of the tympanic membrane) with or without grommet insertion is an effective treatment. It relieves pressure, drains fluid, and can prevent complications like TM rupture or mastoiditis.

================================================================================
Question 372 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old man has presented to outpatient complaining of hoarseness of voice for the last 15 months persistent and progressive. Neck examination is normal and indirect laryngoscopy shows ulcerated growth on left vocal cord anterior one-third with normal movements. His flexible endoscopy shows same findings only white patch on right cord. What is the most likely T Stage of the disease in this case?

Options:
  Stage 1
  Stage 1a
✓ Stage 1b
  Stage 2a
  Stage 2b

Explanation:
For laryngeal carcinoma, an ulcerated growth on the vocal cord with normal vocal cord movements places it in T1. The presence of a lesion on one vocal cord (ulcerated growth on left) and a separate suspicious lesion on the contralateral cord (white patch on right) indicates involvement of both vocal cords, classifying it as T1b (tumor involves both vocal cords, but with normal mobility).

================================================================================
Question 373 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 9 year old patient has presented to outpatient department complaining of nasal obstruction and decreased hearing level in his both ears. Examinations shows high arched palate and dull tymapanic membrane with loss of landmarks. XRay nasopharynx shows enlarged Adenoids. What is the most likely type of hearing loss in this case?

Options:
✓ Conductive hearing loss
  Mixed hearing loss
  Profound hearing loss
  Sensory Neural Hearing loss
  Sudden Sensory Neural Hearing loss

Explanation:
Enlarged adenoids can obstruct the Eustachian tubes, leading to middle ear effusion and a dull tympanic membrane with loss of landmarks. This results in a conductive hearing loss due to impaired sound transmission through the middle ear.

================================================================================
Question 374 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old man has presented to outpatient department complaining of hoarseness of voice for the last 18 months that is persistent and progressive. He is farmer by profession. His neck examination is normal and indirect laryngoscopy shows ulcerated growth on right vocal cord anterior mid-portion with normal movements. His flexible endoscopy shows same findings, the patient is staged as T1aN0M0. Histopathology report shows Squamous Cell Carcinoma. After counseling for treatment, he is reluctant to go for Radiotherapy. What is the most likely next treatment option in this case?

Options:
  Chemotherapy
✓ Cordectomy
  Partial laryngectomy
  Subepithelial Cordectomy
  Total Laryngectomy

Explanation:
For T1a glottic squamous cell carcinoma, both radiotherapy and endoscopic laser cordectomy (a type of cordectomy) offer excellent cure rates with voice preservation. If the patient is reluctant for radiotherapy, surgical cordectomy (removal of the affected part of the vocal cord) is a standard alternative treatment option.

================================================================================
Question 375 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 9 years old boy has presented to consultant outpatient complaining of bilateral decreased hearing level for the last 2 months. Otoscopy shows dull tympanic membrane and Tympanometry reveals type B tympanogram. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Acute suppurative otitis media
  Chronic otitis media
  Retracted tympanic membrane
✓ Secretory otitis media
  Tympanosclerosis

Explanation:
Bilateral decreased hearing, dull tympanic membranes, and a Type B tympanogram (indicating a non-mobile or stiff middle ear system due to fluid) are classic findings for secretory otitis media (SOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME).

================================================================================
Question 376 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old hypertensive man presented to emergency department with history of sudden onset severe epistaxis. After proper history, examination and investigation anterior nasal packing was done but unsuccessful. You are called for vessel ligation under general anesthesia through endoscope. What is the most appropriate vessel to be ligated through endoscope to stop bleeding?

Options:
  Anterior ethmoidal artery
  Posterior ethmoidal artery
✓ Septal branch of spheno-palatine artery
  Septal branch of greater palatine artery
  Septal branch of superior labial artery

Explanation:
Severe epistaxis that is refractory to anterior nasal packing often indicates posterior bleeding, which typically originates from the sphenopalatine artery or its branches. Endoscopic ligation of the sphenopalatine artery (including its septal branch) is the most appropriate surgical intervention to control such bleeding.

================================================================================
Question 377 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16 year old boy has presented to Emergency Room with sudden onset of headache and vomiting. He has also history of foul smell right ear discharge for the last 6 years.

✓ T3NoMo
  T4NoMa
  T11NoMa

Explanation:
For laryngeal carcinoma, a fixed vocal cord automatically stages the tumor as T3. The information about the ulcerated growth involving the vocal cord but with no extension to the thyroid cartilage, and assuming no nodal or distant metastasis (implied by N0M0, despite typos), confirms the T3 stage.

================================================================================
Question 379 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old male patient is presented to otolaryngology specialist clinic complaining of hoarseness of voice for the last 3 months. He Is chronic smoker and was using medicines for heartburn. Flexible laryngoscopy shows grayish white patches on anterior two-third of both mobile vocal cords. Under direct laryngoscopy, the plaques could not be easily excised. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Contact ulcers
  Hyperkeratosis
✓ Leukoplakia
  Squamous cell carcinoma
  Verricous carcinoma

Explanation:
Persistent hoarseness with grayish-white patches on the vocal cords of a chronic smoker that cannot be easily excised are characteristic features of leukoplakia. Leukoplakia is a clinical term for a white patch that cannot be wiped off and is often a precancerous lesion, especially in smokers.

================================================================================
Question 380 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 17 year old girl was brought to the emergency room complaining of difficulty in breathing for two days. She also gives history of dental manipulation. On examination, the tongue is protruded with reduced movements. Which one of the following is the most likely organism responsible for this condition?

Options:
  Haemophilius influenza
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  Staphylococus aureus
  Streptococcus pneumonae
✓ Streptococcus viridans

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of difficulty breathing, protruded tongue with reduced movements, and a history of recent dental manipulation is highly suggestive of Ludwig's angina, a severe cellulitis of the floor of the mouth. This condition often results from odontogenic infections, and *Streptococcus viridans* (a common oral commensal) is a frequent causative organism.

================================================================================
Question 381 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 year old high school teacher has presented to outpatient complaining of hoarseness of voice for the last 16 months persistent and progressive. Neck examination is unremarkable, and Flexible laryngoscopy shows ulcerated growth on right vocal cord anterior one-third with normal movements. This patient is Stage as TiaNOMO, according to AJCC. What is the most appropriate treatment option?

Options:
  Chemoradiotheraphy
  Chemoradiotheraphy
✓ Radiotheraphy
  Cordectomy segmental Subepithelial Cordectomy
  Total Laryngectomy

Explanation:
For T1aN0M0 glottic squamous cell carcinoma (ulcerated growth on vocal cord with normal movement), radiotherapy is one of the primary treatment options. It offers excellent cure rates with the potential for voice preservation, and it is a well-established and appropriate treatment for this early stage of cancer.

================================================================================
Question 382 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12 year old boy has come to Outpatient clinic complaining of discharge from his right ear for the last 2 days. On examination the tympanic membrane has central perforation with red congested mucosa and mucoid discharge. Which one of the following is the most likely causative organism responsible upon the report of culture and sensitivity test?

Options:
  H.influenzae
  Pneumococcus
✓ Pseudomonas Aurgenosa
  Staphylococcus
  Streptococcus

Explanation:
In acute otitis media with central perforation and mucoid discharge (often indicative of an exacerbation of CSOM), *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a very common causative organism, especially in cases with ongoing discharge or a history of water exposure.

================================================================================
Question 383 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 7 year old girl was brought to toutpatient by her parents complaining of bilateral decreased hearing and nasal obstruction for the last 3 months. On otoscopy, she has bilateral dull tympanic membranes with loss of landmarks and is a mouth breather. Tympanometry reveals type B graph. What is the most effective treatment of choice in this case?

Options:
  Adeno Tonsillectomy
✓ Adenodectomy with Grometts insertion.
  Conservative treatment with analgesics
  Conservative treatment with antibiotics
  Myringotomy with ventilation, tube insertion

Explanation:
The combination of bilateral decreased hearing, nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, dull tympanic membranes, and a Type B tympanogram indicates otitis media with effusion (OME) secondary to enlarged adenoids. The most effective treatment is adenoidectomy (removal of the adenoids to address the obstruction) combined with myringotomy and grommet insertion (ventilation tubes) to drain the middle ear fluid and improve hearing.

================================================================================
Question 384 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 year old boy is scheduled for diagnostic bronchoscopy. Clinical examination and XRay chest are normal. During rigid bronchoscopy, a piece of peanut was removed. In the recovery room the patient was not maintaining O2 saturation, with hyperresonant chest on percussion. What is the next step in the treatment of this patient?

Options:
  Endotracheal intubation
  Chest intubation
✓ ReBronchoscopy
  Tracheostomy
  Ventilator support

Explanation:
After removal of an airway foreign body, if the patient develops desaturation and hyperresonance on the chest, it raises concern for residual foreign body, airway edema causing persistent obstruction, or a complication like a pneumothorax (though hyperresonance usually suggests air trapping). Re-bronchoscopy would be the next step to re-evaluate the airway for any missed fragments, assess mucosal swelling, or rule out a post-extraction complication that might be causing ongoing obstruction/air trapping.

================================================================================
Question 385 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 year old lady is coming to specialist clinic complaining of difficulty in swallowing for the last 2 years. She has history of total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma 3 years back. Her Barium swallow is normal and flexible endoscopy shows right vocal cord paralysis. What is the most likely cause of dysphagia in this case?

Options:
✓ Decreased pharyngeal gradient pressure and decreased glottis closure
  Decreased pharyngeal gradient pressure and increased glottis closure
  Increased pharyngeal gradient pressure and increased glottis closure
  Increased pharyngeal gradient pressure and decreased glottis closure
  Superior constrictor muscle and cricothyroid muscle dysfunction

Explanation:
Unilateral vocal cord paralysis (a potential complication of thyroidectomy due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury) primarily causes dysphagia by impairing glottic closure. This leads to inefficient protection of the airway during swallowing, causing aspiration and difficulty in bolus transport. While the exact phrasing of 'decreased pharyngeal gradient pressure' might be debated, the 'decreased glottis closure' is a direct and significant cause of dysphagia in this context.

================================================================================
Question 386 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 year old boy presented to the Consultant Clinic complaining of sore throat and difficulty in swallowing for the last 06 months associated with fever body aches and pains. The patient is appearing in professional examination. On examination of the oral cavity the tongue having white reddish spots, multiple and tender to touch. What is the most likely clinical diagnosis in this case?

Options:
✓ Apthus ulcers
  Erythroplakia
  Leukoplakia
  Submucosal fibrosis
  Squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation:
The chronic nature of sore throat and difficulty swallowing, along with multiple, tender, whitish-reddish spots on the tongue, is most consistent with recurrent aphthous ulcers. While other chronic inflammatory conditions could present, aphthous ulcers are common, painful, and can recur over long periods.

================================================================================
Question 387 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old boy was brought to emergency room by his parents complaining of sore throat, headache and difficulty in opening mouth for the last threedays. His both tonsils are covered by white follicles and the left tonsil is enlarged medially anterior to the posterior pillar with deviation of the uvula to the opposite side. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute follicular tonsillitis
  Infectious mononucleosis
  Membranous tonsillitis
✓ Peritonsillar abscesses
  Parapharyngeal abscesses

Explanation:
The classic presentation of unilateral tonsil enlargement with medial deviation, uvula deviation to the opposite side, and trismus (difficulty opening mouth) in the context of sore throat and fever, is diagnostic of a peritonsillar abscess (quinsy).

================================================================================
Question 388 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 9 years old boy presented to consultant clinic for pain in the throat, fever, and severe body aches for the last 4 days. On examination, the oropharynx is congested with whitish layers and red spots, neck is also swollen and tender. What is the investigation of choice in this patient?

Options:
  ASOTitre
  Complete Blood Picture
  Culture and Sensitivity
  Paul Bunnel Test
✓ Rapid Antigen test

Explanation:
For acute pharyngitis with signs suggestive of streptococcal infection (whitish layers/exudates, congested oropharynx, tender neck nodes), a Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) for Group A Streptococcus is the investigation of choice for immediate diagnosis, guiding early antibiotic treatment and preventing complications like rheumatic fever.

================================================================================
Question 389 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16 year old girl presented to the Consultant Clinic complaining of swelling in the floor of mouth for the last 06 months that is progressive. The swelling is bluish in color, soft, not tender on left side of the frenulum and on ventral of the tongue. What is the most likely clinical diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Dermoid cyst
  Granuloma
  Papilloma
✓ Ranula
  Submandibular duct stone

Explanation:
A soft, bluish, non-tender, slowly progressive swelling in the floor of the mouth, especially lateral to the frenulum, is a classic presentation of a ranula, which is a mucocele (retention cyst) of the sublingual salivary gland.

================================================================================
Question 390 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 year old boy presented to emergency room complaining of burning sensation in the throat and difficulty in chewing food for the last 06 months associated with fever body aches and pains. The patient is addicted to Pan (Betel quid) and smoking. On examination of the oral cavity mobile mucosal surfaces of the tongue having white reddish spots, multiple and tender to touch. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Apthus ulcers
  Erythroplakia
  Leukoplakia
  Lichen planus
✓ Submucosal fibrosis

Explanation:
The long history of burning sensation, difficulty chewing, and the risk factors of betel quid chewing and smoking are strongly associated with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF). OSMF is a chronic, progressive, precancerous condition characterized by blanching, stiffness, and eventual immobility of oral mucosal surfaces, leading to difficulty with chewing and swallowing. The 'white reddish spots' might represent associated inflammatory changes, but the overall picture with betel quid use points to OSMF.

================================================================================
Question 391 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old man presented to outpatient complaining of hoarseness of voice for the last 12 months that is and progressive. Neck examination shows single ipsilateral lymph node less than 6cm, and indirect laryngoscopy shows ulcerated growth on the anterior one-third of the right vocal cord anterior one-third with normal movements. His flexible endoscopy shows same findings. What is the most likely TNM Stage of the disease in this case according to AGCC (American joint committee for cancer)?

Options:
✓ T1N1Mo
  T1N10Mo
  T1N20M1
  T1N10M2
  T₁N20M2

Explanation:
The ulcerated growth on the vocal cord with normal movements is T1 (confined to larynx, mobile cord). A single ipsilateral lymph node less than 6cm falls under N1 (single ipsilateral node <=3cm) or N2a (single ipsilateral node >3cm but <=6cm). Since the options given are in the format T1N1Mo, and the node is <6cm, N1 is the best fit, assuming it falls within the <=3cm category or simplified context, and with no distant metastasis (M0). The options with N10, N20, M1, M2 appear to be typos or highly unusual staging notations.

================================================================================
Question 392 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 9 years old boy was brought to emergency room by his mother complaining of sore throat, headache and severe body aches and pains. His both tonsils are covered by white follicles and on examination enlarged level-2 neck nodes on both sides. Which of the following is the most likely organisms which can cause for valvular heart disease in future?

Options:
  Group b haemolytic streptococci
  H-influenzae
  Staphylococus aureus
  Streptococcus viridans
✓ Streptococus pyogenes

Explanation:
*Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Streptococcus) is the causative agent of streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat). Untreated or inadequately treated strep throat can lead to acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which is a major cause of acquired valvular heart disease in children.

================================================================================
Question 393 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16 year old girl presented to consultant outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, foreign body sensation in the throat and change in voice for 12 hours. On examination, the patient is anxious with sweating. What is the most appropriate treatment in this case?

Options:
  Cricothyrodoctomy
  IV Antibiotics
✓ Mask oxygenation
  Tracheostomy
  Ventilator support

Explanation:
The acute onset of fever, foreign body sensation in the throat, and voice change, along with anxiety and sweating, suggests acute upper airway obstruction (e.g., epiglottitis). The most immediate and appropriate initial treatment is mask oxygenation to maintain oxygen saturation while definitive airway management is prepared.

================================================================================
Question 394 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 49 year old man presented to outpatient complaining of non-healing ulcer on right middle of the tongue for the last 7 months that is progressive. Neck examination shows one mobile neck node less than 3cm in greater diameter. What is the most likely investigation in this case to establish the diagnosis?

Options:
  CT-scan oral cavity
✓ Incisional biopsy under general anesthesia
  Incisional biopsy under surface anesthesia
  MRI
  Ultrasound b-mode tongue

Explanation:
A progressive non-healing ulcer on the tongue, especially with an associated palpable neck node, is highly suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma. To establish a definitive diagnosis, an incisional biopsy of the lesion is essential. Given the chronic nature and potential for deep involvement, performing it under general anesthesia ensures adequate tissue sampling and patient comfort.

================================================================================
Question 395 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 7 year old boy was brought to emergency room by his mother complaining of sore throat, headache and difficulty in breathing. His both tonsils are covered by grey, white membrane; red spots on the soft palate and periorbital edema are noted. The neck has enlarged tender lymph nodes on both sides. His lymphocyte/WBC ratio is higher than 0.35. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute membranous tonsillitis
  Acute follicular tonsillitis
  Candidiasis
✓ Diphtheria
  Infectious mononucleosis

Explanation:
The presence of a grey-white membrane covering both tonsils, along with sore throat, difficulty breathing, red spots on the soft palate, periorbital edema, and enlarged tender lymph nodes, is highly characteristic of diphtheria, a severe bacterial infection caused by *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*.

================================================================================
Question 396 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42 year old man presented to the outpatient department complaining of difficulty in breathing and swallowing her the last 10 days that is progressive. Oral examination shows swelling in the oropharynx on right side and the well oriented. Xray neck lateral view with extensions shows increased shadow of the retropharynx with corresponding vertebrae. What is the most appropriate treatment in this case?

Options:
  Anti-Tubercul ar Therapy
✓ Incisi on and drainage through cervicali ncision
  WAntibiotics
  Peroral Incisi on and drainage
  Tracheostomy

Explanation:
The progressive difficulty breathing and swallowing, right oropharyngeal swelling, and increased retropharyngeal shadow on X-ray are classic signs of a retropharyngeal abscess. The most appropriate treatment for a retropharyngeal abscess is urgent incision and drainage, often performed through an external cervical incision to ensure complete drainage and prevent further spread or airway compromise. Antibiotics alone are insufficient for an established abscess.

================================================================================
Question 397 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 17-year-old boy was listed for tonsillectomy for repeated sore throat. On examination, the tonsil and enlarged size as grade-4. During surgical intervention, both tonsils were dissected while enlarged adenoids were left and not shaved. What is the most likely absolute contraindication for adenoids surgery in this case?

Options:
  Aberrant pharyngeal artery
  Bifid uvula
  Nasopharyngeal insufficiency
  Sinusitis
✓ Suspected Angiofibroma

Explanation:
Suspected angiofibroma is an absolute contraindication for routine adenoidectomy. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a highly vascular tumor of the nasopharynx that can cause severe, life-threatening hemorrhage during surgery. If suspected, specialized surgical planning and preparation (e.g., embolization) are required.

================================================================================
Question 398 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 47 year old man was brought to the emergency room complaining of hoarseness of voice for the last 12 months persistent and progressive and now difficulty in breathing for the last two days. He is giving history of Carcinoma Larynx for which he received radiation. Flexible laryngoscopy shows fixed vocal cords with ulcerated growth and CT Scan shows heterogeneously enhancing lesion involving vocal corda and thyroid cartilages sparing pharyngeal mucosa. What is most management option in this case?

Options:
  Chemotherapy
  Neoadjunct radiotherapy
  Partial Laryngectomy
  Palliative care
✓ Total Laryngectomy

Explanation:
For advanced laryngeal carcinoma (fixed vocal cords, cartilage involvement, recurrent after radiation) with airway compromise, total laryngectomy is often the most appropriate definitive management option. Partial laryngectomy is unlikely to be sufficient, and palliative care is considered when curative options are exhausted or not feasible.

================================================================================
Question 399 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You received a consultation call of a 2 year old patient who is in severe respiratory distress for the last 2 days. He is not maintaining saturation. On examination, the patient is in inspiratory distress with intercostal recession and X-Ray shows steeple sign. Saturation is decreasing and the patient develops peripheral cyanosis. What is the most suitable management option in this case?

Options:
  Bronchoscopy
  Cricothyrodoctomy
✓ Endotracheal Intubation
  Mask oxygenation with helium
  Tracheostomy

Explanation:
The patient's severe respiratory distress, decreasing saturation, peripheral cyanosis, and steeple sign (classic for croup) indicate critical airway obstruction and impending respiratory failure. Endotracheal intubation is the most suitable immediate management to secure the airway and provide ventilatory support.

================================================================================
Question 400 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old boy presented to emergency room spitting repeated bloodstained saliva from the oral cavity. He has history of tonsillectomy 9 days back. On examination right tonsillar fossa has clot with white slough. The patient is haemodynamically stable, but pale and tries to vomit; saturation is 96% and Hb 9g/dl with raised TLC count. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:
  Blood transfusions
  Crystalloids infusions
  IV Antibiotics
✓ Ligation of blood vessel under general anesthesia
  Packing of the tonsil bed with Adrenaline socked

Explanation:
The patient has secondary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (9 days post-op) with active bleeding (blood-stained saliva, clot), anemia (Hb 9g/dl), and signs of infection (white slough, raised TLC). Despite being hemodynamically stable currently, significant ongoing bleeding warrants surgical intervention. Ligation of the bleeding vessel under general anesthesia is the most appropriate definitive management.

================================================================================
Question 401 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 8-year-old male patient is brought by his mother with complaints of sore throat and fever for which he received treatment from a General Physician. However, his symptoms have worsened after receiving the prescribed medications. He is now unable to swallow for the last 2 days. On examination, his both tonsils are covered by white membrane and neck has palpable neck nodes at level 2. His Complete Blood Picture shows Lymphocytosis. What is the most likely drug responsible for exacerbation of his symptoms?

Options:
✓ Amaxicillin
  Brufen
  Cefaclor
  Cefadroxil
  Clarthromycine

Explanation:
The symptoms (sore throat, fever, white membrane on tonsils, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytosis) suggest infectious mononucleosis (IM). Giving amoxicillin to a patient with IM often leads to a characteristic maculopapular rash, which can be perceived as a worsening of symptoms or an adverse drug reaction, but is not an allergy.

================================================================================
Question 402 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You received a consultation call of a 02-day-old infant from Nursery of child health department stating that the baby has difficulty in breathing while awake. According to the mother, the feeding and sleep of the baby is adequate. On examination, the baby is not cyanosed and is having mild chest recession, Flexible laryngoscopy shows short aryepiglottic folds. What is the most likely clinical diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Choanal atresia
  Epiglottitis
✓ Laryngomalacia
  Laryngotracheobronchitis
  Vocal cord Web

Explanation:
Inspiratory distress with mild chest recession in a 2-day-old infant, coupled with laryngoscopic findings of short aryepiglottic folds, is highly indicative of laryngomalacia. Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of congenital stridor, resulting from the collapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration.

================================================================================
Question 403 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4 years old child was brought to outpatient of consultant clinic by his nasal obstruction, decreased hearing level and foul smell from right nostril for the last 7 days. On examination, there is mucopus in the right nostril, postnasal drip and dull tympanic membrane. What parents with complain of snoring the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Adenoids
✓ Foreign body nose
  Maxillary sinusitis
  Otitis media with effusion
  Septal abscesses

Explanation:
Unilateral, foul-smelling nasal discharge with nasal obstruction in a child, often accompanied by mucopus and postnasal drip, is a classic presentation of a foreign body in the nose, which typically causes a secondary infection. The decreased hearing and dull TM are likely secondary to Eustachian tube dysfunction.

================================================================================
Question 404 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A diagnosed case of chronic otitis media has presented to Emergency Room complaining of post actual weig for the 7 days. Otoscopic examination shows cholesteatoma in attic region of left ear. Pure Tone Audiometry nos Air Bone Gip of 10db, and CT Scan shows opacity in the antrum Most likely treatment in this case

Options:
  Cortical mastoidectomy
  Conservative Management
✓ Modified Radical Mastidectomy
  Mastoid exploration
  Radical Mastidectomy

Explanation:
The presence of cholesteatoma in the attic region with signs of mastoid involvement (post-aural swelling, opacity in the antrum) necessitates surgical eradication of the disease. Modified Radical Mastoidectomy (MRM) is a common and appropriate surgical procedure for cholesteatoma that aims to remove the disease while preserving some middle ear structures and hearing (as indicated by the 10dB air-bone gap).

================================================================================
Question 405 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A middle-aged man visited ENT Clinic for a routine oral cavity examination for the complaints of foreign body sensation in the throat. On examination, he has right-sided tonsillar enlargement. The attending surgeon counselled the patient for early surgical intervention. What are the most likely absolute indication for early tonsil surgery in this case?

Options:
  Acute tonsillitis
  Chronic tonsillitis
✓ Malignancy
  Sleep apnea
  Peritonsillar abscesses

Explanation:
Unilateral tonsillar enlargement in an adult, especially when associated with a foreign body sensation or other suspicious symptoms, is a red flag for malignancy (e.g., tonsillar lymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma). This is considered an absolute indication for early tonsillectomy (or biopsy) for diagnostic purposes.

================================================================================
Question 406 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 year old child was brought to the emergency room by her mother with complaints of difficulty in breathing and is unable to speak for the last 2 hours. The mother told that the kid was playing with toys On examination the child is in respiratory distress, and is cyanosed and exhausted. Her X-Ray chest is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
✓ Acute Epiglottitis
  Acute Tracheobronchitis
  Foreign body Tracheobronchial tree
  Laryngitis
  Laryngomalacia

Explanation:
The acute onset of difficulty breathing, inability to speak (aphonia), respiratory distress, cyanosis, and exhaustion in a child is a life-threatening airway emergency. While playing with toys raises suspicion for a foreign body, acute epiglottitis (though less common now due to vaccination) presents with a rapidly progressing sore throat, dysphagia, drooling, and muffled or absent voice, leading to severe respiratory distress. A normal chest X-ray does not rule out upper airway obstruction.

================================================================================
Question 407 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old girl was scheduled for tonsillectomy for repeated sore throat. On examination, the tonsils are enlarged in size with bilateral neck nodes. During surgery, the left tonsil has a bleeding vessel that bleeds repeatedly and a 2nd year resident is unable to control it. He has called for help of senior consultant. What is the most likely vessel that needs ligation in this case?

Options:
  Ascending Pharyngeal artery branch
✓ Branch of facial artery
  Descending Pharyngeal artery branch
  Lingual artery branch
  Paratonsillar vein

Explanation:
The tonsils are highly vascular. The main arterial supply to the palatine tonsils comes from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery. Persistent, uncontrolled bleeding during tonsillectomy often necessitates ligation of this or other major branches of the external carotid artery system that supply the tonsil, with the facial artery being a key source.

================================================================================
Question 408 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old man was to the brought to the emergency room complaining of difficulty in breathing for the last three days. He is uncontrolled diabetic, that and also giving history dental manipulation by Dentist. On examination the tongue is protruded with sublingual swelling. What is the most appropriate clinical diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Ludwighs Angina
  Parapharyngeal abscesses.
  Retropharyngeal abscesses
  Submandibular duct stone
  Submandibular abscesses

Explanation:
The rapidly progressive difficulty breathing, protruded tongue with sublingual swelling, and a history of recent dental manipulation in an uncontrolled diabetic (who is immunocompromised) are classic signs of Ludwig's angina. This is a severe, rapidly spreading cellulitis of the floor of the mouth that can quickly compromise the airway.

================================================================================
Question 409 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 18 year old boy presents to Emergency department with history of severe headache which he claims to be the worst of his life. Headache is associated with vomiting and neck pain. Patient is giving history of nasal obstruction and post-nasal drip. On examination, there is mucopus in both nostrils. What specific investigation you would like to order immediately?

Options:
  CSF analysis
✓ CT Brain & PNS with contrast
  CT Brain without contrast
  MRI Brain
  Pet scan

Explanation:
The 'worst headache of his life' with meningeal signs (neck pain, vomiting) is a red flag for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which primarily requires an unenhanced CT brain. However, the co-existing nasal obstruction, post-nasal drip, and mucopus suggest sinusitis, which can lead to intracranial complications (e.g., meningitis, abscess). A CT scan of the brain with contrast, combined with a CT of the paranasal sinuses, would provide a comprehensive evaluation for both potential causes of severe headache and any associated complications.

================================================================================
Question 410 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 39 year old lady presented to the Emergency room with profuse epistaxis for 4 hours. He has similar episodes in the past. Anterior nasal packing was done in emergency room but bleeding was uncontrolled. All baseline investigations were normal. The consultant decided to control the bleeding under General Anesthesia. What is the most likely vessel that needs to be clipped with Functional Endoscope in this case?

Options:
  Anterior Ethi midal
✓ Spenopalati neartery
  Posterior Ethi midal
  Greater palati neartery
  Septal artery

Explanation:
Profuse epistaxis refractory to anterior nasal packing typically indicates a posterior bleed. The sphenopalatine artery (often misspelled in options as Spenopalatine artery) is the primary arterial supply to the posterior nasal cavity and is the most common target for endoscopic ligation to control severe posterior epistaxis.

================================================================================
Question 411 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A middle age lady presented to outpatients department with complaints of nasal obstruction, headache and postnasal discharge for the last 9 months. Clinical examination, shows unilateral polyp, mucopus and mucin, CT scan shows double density opacity in the nose, Maxillary and Ethmoid region pushing the orbit on same side. What is the most appropriate treatment option in this case?

Options:
  Endoscopic sinus surgery
  Endoscopic sinus surgery plus topical nasal steroi ds.
✓ Endoscopic sinus surgery plus topical and oral steroi ds
  IV Amphoteracine B
  Topical nasal steroi ds

Explanation:
The constellation of chronic unilateral nasal obstruction, headache, mucopus/mucin, unilateral polyp, and the classic 'double-density opacity' on CT (indicating fungal concretions within allergic mucin) that is pushing the orbit, is diagnostic of Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFS). The most appropriate treatment for AFS involves endoscopic sinus surgery for debridement, followed by a prolonged course of topical and oral corticosteroids to manage the allergic inflammation and prevent recurrence.

================================================================================
Question 412 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20-year-old patient presented to ENT outpatient with the complaint of ear discharge for the last 6 years. The discharge is relieved by topical and systemic antibiotics, and aggravated by water entry. On clinical examination, he is diagnosed with Cholesteatoma right ear. What is the most likely preoperative investigation to help in management plan?

Options:
  CT scan with IV contrast
✓ CT Scan axial and coronal cuts
  CT scan Sagittal view

Question 413 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A middle-aged lady presented to outpatients department with complaints of nasal obstruction, headache and postnasal discharge for the last 9 months. Clinical examination shows unilateral polyp, mucopus and mucin. CT scan shows double-density opacity in the nose, maxillary and ethmoid region pushing the orbit on the same side. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Antrochoanal polyp
✓ Allergic fungal sinusitis
  Ethimoidal polypi
  Invertid papilloma
  Maxillary sinusitis

Explanation:
The 'double-density opacity' on CT scan, along with chronic unilateral nasal obstruction, headache, mucopus, mucin, and an expansile lesion pushing the orbit, is a classic presentation of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFS). This radiological sign represents fungal concretions within allergic mucin.

Question 626 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4 years old female child presented with complaints of delayed speech and decreased hearing since childhood. O/E both tympanic membranes looked normal. She was investigated and found to have a sensorineural hearing loss of 95db. She was put in the cochlear implant surgery program. Before embarking on surgery, which investigation should be ordered:

Options:
  Brain stem evoked response audiometry
  CT scan to rule out inner ear anomalies
  Midbrain evoked potentials
✓ MRI to rule out brain pathology
  PET scan for viable audiologic pathways

Explanation:
While CT scans are used to assess bony anatomy, MRI is the gold standard pre-operative investigation for cochlear implants to assess the patency of the cochlea (fluid status) and, crucially, to confirm the presence and integrity of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), ensuring it is not aplastic.

================================================================================
Question 627 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male with involved in a road traffic accident. He presented to ER with a concussion and a fractured nose. He is managed conservatively and is making good progress after being shifted to ward. The next day, the surgeon on call receives a call from the ward that the patient has clear fluid coming out from nose, particularly on bending forward and is unable to sniff it back. The investigation to be done in this case is:

Options:
✓ B2 transferrin
  CSF analysis
  serum aldosterone levels
  MRI brain
  urinary catecholamines

Explanation:
The clinical picture suggests CSF Rhinorrhea (CSF leak) following head trauma, indicated by the 'reservoir sign' (fluid dripping on bending forward). The most specific test to confirm the fluid is Cerebrospinal Fluid is the detection of Beta-2 Transferrin, a protein found almost exclusively in CSF.

================================================================================

Question:
Plummer – Vinson syndrome is:

Options:
  Malignant condition
✓ Pre-malignant
  Locally malignant
  None of the above
  Infection of the pharynx

Explanation:
Plummer-Vinson syndrome is considered a pre-malignant (premalignant) condition because it is associated with an increased risk of developing postcricoid carcinoma (squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx/esophagus).

================================================================================

Question:
Which is true about laryngeal carcinoma:

Options:
  Commoner in males.
  The commonest type is squamous cell carcinoma
  Is predisposed by smoking
✓ All of the above
  None of the above

Explanation:
Laryngeal carcinoma is indeed commoner in males, with squamous cell carcinoma being the predominant histological type (over 90%), and smoking is the most significant predisposing factor. Therefore, all of the above statements are true.

================================================================================
Question 738 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The site of singer’s nodules is:

Options:
  At the epiglottis
✓ At the junction of the anterior 1/3 with posterior 2/3 of VC
  At the arytenoids
  None of the above
  Anterior Cammissure

Explanation:
Singer's nodules (vocal fold nodules) typically occur symmetrically at the junction of the anterior one-third and posterior two-thirds of the true vocal cords, which is the point of maximal vibratory trauma.

================================================================================
Question 739 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Leucoplakia of the larynx is:

Options:
✓ Epithelial hyperplasia
  Epithelial hypertrophy
  Epithelial degeneration
  No histological Changes
  Only redness of the larynx

Explanation:
Leukoplakia of the larynx (a white patch on the vocal cord) is a clinical term for a lesion that histologically represents epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. It is considered a precancerous lesion, as it can progress to dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma.

================================================================================
Question 740 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The tube may slip due to:

Options:
  Small sized tube.
  Pulled out by violent cough.
  Loosely tied tape.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
A tracheostomy tube can slip or become displaced due to several factors: if the tube is too small for the stoma, if it is not secured tightly enough (loosely tied tape), or if a violent cough generates enough force to dislodge it. Therefore, all of the listed reasons are potential causes.

================================================================================
Question 741 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Structures in the larynx responsible for sphincteric function:

Options:
  Vocal cords.
  Ventricular bands.
  Aryepiglottic folds.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
The larynx has three levels of sphincteric protection to prevent aspiration: the aryepiglottic folds (supraglottic), the ventricular bands (false vocal cords), and the true vocal cords (glottis). All of these structures contribute to the sphincteric function of the larynx.

================================================================================
Question 742 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Laryngeal stenosis may be due to:

Options:
  Scleroma.
  Congenital.
  Traumatic.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
Laryngeal stenosis can be congenital (e.g., webs, subglottic stenosis) or acquired. Acquired causes include trauma (e.g., intubation injury, external trauma) and chronic inflammatory conditions like scleroma (rhinoscleroma affecting the larynx). Thus, all the options are valid causes.

================================================================================
Question 743 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Apnea immediately after opening the trachea is due to:

Options:
  Rise of the blood carbon dioxide level.
  Fall of the blood 02 level.
✓ Wash out of the blood carbon dioxide level
  None of the above.

Explanation:
In patients with chronic upper airway obstruction, the respiratory drive is often maintained by hypoxic drive or high CO2 levels. When the trachea is opened (tracheostomy), the obstruction is suddenly relieved, leading to a rapid washout of accumulated CO2. This sudden drop in PaCO2 removes the primary respiratory stimulus, causing temporary apnea (apnea of relief).

================================================================================
Question 744 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Inhaled smooth small FB is commonly arrested in:

Options:
  The larynx.
  The trachea.
✓ The right bronchus.
  The left bronchus.

Explanation:
Inhaled foreign bodies (FB) are most commonly arrested in the right main bronchus because it is wider, shorter, and more vertical (more in line with the trachea) than the left main bronchus.

================================================================================
Question 745 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
30 years old female suffering form bilateral nasal obstruction, crusty nose, hoarseness of voice & stridor. The most probable cause is:

Options:
  Allergic rhinitis.
  Vasomotor rhinitis.
✓ Rhino laryngo scleroma.
  Acute rhinosinusitis.

Explanation:
The constellation of symptoms involving the nose (obstruction, crusting) and the larynx (hoarseness, stridor) in a young female, specifically with crusting (atrophic stage), points towards Rhinoscleroma (or Scleroma). It is a chronic granulomatous disease that affects the respiratory tract, progressing from the nose to the larynx.

================================================================================
Question 746 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The left recurrent laryngeal nerve passes in the chest around:

Options:
✓ Aortic arch.
  Left main bronchus.
  Thoracic duct.
  Azygos vein.

Explanation:
The left recurrent laryngeal nerve loops around the arch of the aorta in the superior mediastinum before ascending in the tracheoesophageal groove. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve loops around the right subclavian artery.

================================================================================
Question 747 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The commonest cause of breathing difficulty after tracheostomy is:

Options:
  Pneumonia.
✓ Obstruction of the tube by secretion.
  Surgical emphysema.
  Pneumothorax.

Explanation:
Tube obstruction by inspissated secretions (mucus plugs) or blood clots is the most common cause of respiratory difficulty in the immediate postoperative period following a tracheostomy. Regular suctioning and humidification are essential preventive measures.

================================================================================
Question 748 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Laryngeal lesions are investigated by:

Options:
  Ct.
  MRI.
  Endoscopy & biopsy.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
The investigation of laryngeal lesions is multimodal. Endoscopy (laryngoscopy) with biopsy is essential for diagnosis. CT and MRI are crucial for staging, assessing the extent of the lesion, cartilage invasion, and nodal involvement.

================================================================================
Question 749 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Infection reaching the submental & submandibular space is called:

Options:
  Vincent angina.
✓ Ludwig's angina.
  Submandibular sialadenitis.
  Bezold's abscess.

Explanation:
Ludwig's angina is a rapidly spreading cellulitis involving the submandibular, sublingual, and submental spaces bilaterally. It is a serious condition that can lead to airway obstruction.

================================================================================
Question 750 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Vincent angina is characterized by:

Options:
  Very sever systemic symptoms & mild local symptoms.
✓ Very sever local symptoms & mild systemic symptoms.
  Very sever local & systemic symptoms.
  Very mild local & systemic symptoms.

Explanation:
Vincent's angina (acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis/pharyngitis) typically presents with severe local symptoms like painful, ulcerative gums or tonsils, foul breath, and bleeding, but systemic symptoms (like high fever) are often mild or disproportionately less severe compared to the local appearance.

================================================================================
Question 751 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Contraindication of tonsillectomy includes all of the following EXCEPT:

Options:
  Hemophilia.
  Acute attack.
✓ One attack of quinsy 2 months ago.
  Active rheumatic arthritis.

Explanation:
Contraindications for tonsillectomy include bleeding disorders (like hemophilia) unless corrected, acute infection (acute attack), and systemic conditions like active rheumatic fever/arthritis (until controlled). A history of quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) is actually an *indication* for interval tonsillectomy to prevent recurrence, not a contraindication.

================================================================================
Question 752 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Pain in the ear in cases of acute tonsillitis or following tonsillectomy is referred via:

Options:
  5th nerve.
✓ 9th nerve.
  10th nerve.
  12th nerve.

Explanation:
Referred otalgia (ear pain) from the tonsil or tonsillar fossa is mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). The tympanic branch of CN IX (Jacobson's nerve) supplies sensation to the middle ear, and the tonsillar branch supplies the tonsil.

================================================================================
Question 753 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Haemorrhage within the 24 hours following tonsillectomy:

Options:
  Primary.
✓ Reactionary.
  Secondary.
  None of the above.

Explanation:
Reactionary hemorrhage is defined as bleeding that occurs within the first 24 hours after surgery (typically within 4-6 hours), usually due to the slipping of a ligature, dislodgement of a clot, or cessation of reflex vasoconstriction as blood pressure normalizes.

================================================================================
Question 754 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Haemorrhage during the operation of tonsillectomy is:

Options:
✓ Primary.
  Reactionary.
  Secondary.
  None of the above.

Explanation:
Primary hemorrhage is defined as bleeding that occurs *during* the surgical procedure itself.

================================================================================
Question 755 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The cause of reactionary haemorrhage after tonsillectomy:

Options:
  Secondary infection.
✓ Rising blood pressure with slipping of ligature.
  Injury of the pharyngeal muscles & mucosa.
  None of the above.

Explanation:
Reactionary hemorrhage is often precipitated by factors that increase venous pressure or dislodge a clot/ligature shortly after surgery, such as rising blood pressure as the patient recovers from anesthesia, coughing, or vomiting.

================================================================================
Question 756 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The cause of suffocation & laryngeal spasm after tonsillectomy:

Options:
  Backward of the tongue.
  Inhalation of vomitus or blood clots.
  Extubation spasm.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
Post-tonsillectomy airway compromise can be caused by the tongue falling backward (especially if the patient is deeply sedated), aspiration of blood or vomitus triggering laryngospasm, or laryngospasm upon extubation. All are potential causes.

================================================================================
Question 757 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The value of post-tonsillectomy position is:

Options:
  To prevent backward falling of tongue.
  To prevent inhalation of the vomitus or blood.
  To detect bleeding.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
The tonsil position (lateral position with head down and slight extension) serves multiple purposes: it keeps the airway open by preventing the tongue from falling back, allows blood and secretions to drain out of the mouth (preventing aspiration/inhalation), and makes active bleeding easier to detect as it trickles out.

================================================================================
Question 758 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
6th nerve paralysis occurs in the following cases EXCEPT:

Options:
  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.
✓ Postcricoid carcinoma.
  Petrositis.

Explanation:
The 6th cranial nerve (abducens) has a long intracranial course and is susceptible to damage in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (via skull base invasion), cavernous sinus thrombosis (it runs through the sinus), and petrositis (Gradenigo's syndrome). Postcricoid carcinoma, being hypopharyngeal, typically affects lower cranial nerves (IX, X, XI, XII) or the sympathetic chain, but does not typically cause isolated 6th nerve palsy.

================================================================================
Question 759 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Tonsillectomy is indicated in all of the following EXCEPT:

Options:
✓ Blood diseases.
  Diphtheria carrier.
  Chronic tonsillitis.
  Impacted FB.

Explanation:
Blood diseases (like leukemia, severe anemia, purpura) are generally *contraindications* for tonsillectomy due to the high risk of bleeding and infection. Diphtheria carriers (to eliminate the carrier state), chronic tonsillitis, and impacted foreign bodies are valid indications.

================================================================================
Question 760 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Tonsillectomy is contraindicated in all of the following EXCEPT:

Options:
  During epidemic of polio.
  During acute attack
  Malignant hypertension.
✓ Diphtheria carrier.

Explanation:
Tonsillectomy is *contraindicated* during a polio epidemic, during an acute infection (acute attack), and in systemic conditions like malignant hypertension. Being a diphtheria carrier is an *indication* for tonsillectomy (to clear the carrier state), not a contraindication.

================================================================================
Question 761 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The most dangerous complication of ludwig's angina is:

Options:
✓ Acute laryngeal edema.
  CHL.
  Bleeding.
  Nasal obstruction.

Explanation:
The most feared and life-threatening complication of Ludwig's angina is airway obstruction due to laryngeal edema and the displacement of the tongue superiorly and posteriorly.

================================================================================
Question 762 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The possible cause of death in case of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is:

Options:
  Recurrent infection.
✓ ever epistaxis.
  Upper respiratory tract obstruction.
  None of the above.

Explanation:
Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a highly vascular tumor. The most significant risk and potential cause of mortality is severe, uncontrolled hemorrhage (epistaxis), either spontaneously or during surgery.

================================================================================
Question 763 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The following antibiotic is contraindicated in infectious mononucleosis:

Options:
✓ Ampicillin.
  Erythromycin.
  Cephalosporin.
  None of the above.

Explanation:
Ampicillin (and amoxicillin) is contraindicated in infectious mononucleosis because it frequently causes a non-allergic maculopapular rash.

================================================================================
Question 764 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Adenoid hypertrophy may lead to all of the following EXCEPT:

Options:
  Adenoid face.
  Otitis media with effusion.
✓ Sensory neural deafness.
  Night mares.

Explanation:
Adenoid hypertrophy can cause Eustachian tube dysfunction leading to otitis media with effusion (conductive deafness), mouth breathing leading to 'adenoid facies', and sleep apnea leading to nightmares. It does not cause sensorineural deafness.

================================================================================
Question 765 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Acute tonsillitis may cause all of the following EXCEPT:

Options:
✓ acute retropharyngeal abscess.
  Acute peritonsillar abscess.
  Para Pharyngeal abscess.
  Quinsy.

Explanation:
Acute tonsillitis can spread directly to cause peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) and parapharyngeal abscess. Acute retropharyngeal abscess is typically due to suppuration of retropharyngeal lymph nodes (from adenoid/nasopharyngeal/sinus infection) in children, not a direct complication of acute tonsillitis in the same way quinsy is.

================================================================================
Question 766 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Chronic retropharyngeal abscess is treated by:

Options:
  Excision through posterior to sternomastoid.
✓ External drainage anterior to sternomastoid.
  Internal drainage via longitudinal incision.
  None of the above.

Explanation:
Chronic retropharyngeal abscess is usually tuberculous (Pott's disease). It is treated by external drainage through an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to prevent secondary infection and fistula formation, combined with anti-tuberculous chemotherapy. (Note: Acute is often drained intraorally, but chronic is external).

================================================================================
Question 767 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The cause of secondary hemorrhage is:

Options:
✓ Wound sepsis.
  Unprepared patient.
  Injury of the pharyngeal muscle.
  Rising of blood pressure with slipping ligature.

Explanation:
Secondary hemorrhage (occurring 5-10 days post-op) is almost always due to wound infection (sepsis) causing erosion of a vessel as the eschar separates.

================================================================================
Question 768 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The pulse in diphtheria is:

Options:
  Full bounding pulse.
✓ Week rapid pulse.
  Synchronous with the temperature.
  Non synchronous with the temperature.

Explanation:
The pulse in diphtheria is characteristically weak and rapid, often disproportionate to the degree of fever (tachycardia out of proportion to temperature), due to the toxic effect on the myocardium (myocarditis).

================================================================================
Question 769 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In a case of 5 years old boy with a membranous faucial lesion, temp 103F and pulse 180/min, the most probable diagnosis is:

Options:
✓ Acute tonsillitis.
  Infectious mononucleosis.
  Acute follicular tonsillitis.
  Diphtheria.
  Agranulocytosis.

Explanation:
High fever (103°F) and rapid pulse are more characteristic of acute septic conditions like acute streptococcal tonsillitis. While diphtheria has a membrane, the fever is usually low-grade. Infectious mononucleosis also has fever and membrane but the acute high fever and tachycardia fit acute bacterial tonsillitis well.

================================================================================
Question 770 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Chronic sinusitis has:

Options:
  Low grade fever.
  Remittent fever.
  Intermittent fever.
✓ No fever.

Explanation:
Chronic sinusitis is typically not associated with fever. Symptoms are more prolonged and include nasal obstruction, discharge, and facial pressure/pain. Fever suggests acute exacerbation or acute sinusitis.

================================================================================
Question 771 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The point of tenderness in acute frontal sinusitis is:

Options:
  The inner canthus.
✓ The supra-orbital margin.
  The infra-orbital margin.
  None of them.

Explanation:
Tenderness in acute frontal sinusitis is typically elicited by applying pressure to the floor of the frontal sinus, which is located just medial to the supra-orbital margin (Ewing's sign).

================================================================================
Question 772 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The point of tenderness in acute ethmoidal sinusitis is: a.

Options:
✓ The inner canthus.
  The supra-orbital margin.
  The infra-orbital margin.
  None of them.

Explanation:
Tenderness in acute ethmoiditis is typically found over the medial wall of the orbit, near the inner canthus.

================================================================================
Question 773 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Unilateral nasal discharge and unilateral nasal obstruction in 13 years boy is most probably diagnostic of:

Options:
  Choanal atresia.
  Adenoids.
  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
✓ None of them.

Explanation:
In a 13-year-old boy, unilateral nasal obstruction and discharge should raise suspicion for a foreign body (less likely at this age), antrochoanal polyp, or nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (associated with epistaxis). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is possible but rare. Choanal atresia presents in infancy. Adenoids are usually bilateral. The *most* probable diagnosis for this specific demographic and presentation isn't perfectly captured by the specific options A-C, though antrochoanal polyp (not listed) is a strong candidate. Among the choices, none is a classic fit for 'most probable' compared to common entities like a polyp or deviated septum/sinusitis. However, if forced to choose pathology, angiofibroma (also not listed) is a key differential. Given options, 'None of them' is a reasonable choice if common causes like polyps are absent.

================================================================================
Question 774 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In frontal sinusitis, the discharge is in:

Options:
✓ The anterior part of the middle meatus.
  The posterior part of the middle meatus.
  All over the middle meatus.
  The inferior meatus.

Explanation:
The frontal sinus drains via the frontonasal duct into the anterior part of the middle meatus (specifically the hiatus semilunaris).

================================================================================
Question 775 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In ethmoidal sinusitis, the discharge is in:

Options:
  The anterior part of the middle meatus.
  The posterior part of the middle meatus.
✓ All over the middle meatus.
  The inferior meatus.

Explanation:
The anterior ethmoid air cells drain into the middle meatus, while the posterior ethmoid air cells drain into the superior meatus. In generalized ethmoiditis or specifically anterior ethmoiditis, discharge can be seen in the middle meatus. However, the option 'all over the middle meatus' is often used to describe the drainage from multiple anterior group sinuses (frontal, maxillary, anterior ethmoid).

================================================================================
Question 776 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is used to confirm nasal allergy:

Options:
  Eosinophilia in nasal secretion.
  eosinophilia in blood.
  elevated serum IgE level.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis (nasal allergy) is supported by finding eosinophils in nasal smears, eosinophilia in the blood, and elevated serum IgE levels (specific or total). Therefore, all of the above can be used.

================================================================================
Question 777 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Alternating nasal obstruction is mainly:

Options:
✓ Allergic.
  Infective.
  Neoplastic.
  None of them.

Explanation:
Alternating nasal obstruction is characteristic of the nasal cycle, which is often exaggerated in allergic rhinitis and vasomotor rhinitis due to mucosal congestion.

================================================================================
Question 778 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The commonest cause of epistaxis in 50 years old man is:

Options:
✓ Hypertension.
  Angio-fibroma.
  Allergic nasal polypi.
  Antrochoanal polyp.

Explanation:
In older adults (e.g., 50 years old), systemic factors like hypertension and atherosclerosis are common predisposing or exacerbating causes of epistaxis.

================================================================================
Question 779 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Non symptomatic deviated nasal septum needs:

Options:
  Septoplasty.
✓ No treatment.
  Sub-mucoperichondrial resection.
  Cauterization.

Explanation:
A deviated nasal septum is a common anatomical finding. If it is asymptomatic (not causing obstruction, sinusitis, etc.), it requires no treatment.

================================================================================
Question 780 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The following is complication of SMR of deviated nasal septum:

Options:
  Septal haematoma.
  Septal abscess.
  Septal perforation.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
Complications of Submucous Resection (SMR) include septal hematoma (collection of blood), septal abscess (if infected), and septal perforation (due to mucosal tear or ischemia). Saddle nose deformity is another potential complication.

================================================================================
Question 781 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Headache in sinusitis is due to:

Options:
  Tension headache.
  Vacuum headache.
  Toxic headache.
✓ All of the above.

Explanation:
Headache in sinusitis can be due to vacuum effect (obstruction of ostia leading to negative pressure), absorption of toxins (toxic headache), and referred pain/tension. Thus, multiple mechanisms contribute.

================================================================================
Question 782 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The time of occurence of headache in frontal sinusitis:

Options:
  All the day.
  At night.
✓ Periodecal.
  None of them.

Explanation:
Headache in acute frontal sinusitis is characteristically periodical ('office headache'). It typically starts in the morning, worsens towards midday as sinus secretions accumulate and pressure increases, and subsides in the late afternoon as the sinus drains.

================================================================================
Question 783 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The following drugs can cause epistaxis EXCEPT:

Options:
  Salicylates.
  Anticoagulants.
  Hypertensive
✓ Ampicilin.

Explanation:
Salicylates (aspirin) and anticoagulants interfere with clotting and can cause epistaxis. Hypertension is a systemic cause. Ampicillin is an antibiotic and does not typically cause epistaxis.

================================================================================
Question 784 (WMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Periodic headache is a characteristic symptoms in:

Options:
✓ Frontal sinusitis.
  Ethmoidal sinusitis.
  Maxillary sinusitis.
  Non of the above.

Explanation:
