================================================================================

================================================================================
Question 1 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 year old man presented with the complaint of difficulty to recognize the faces. Fundus examination shows some disturbance in the macular area. Which one is the most appropriate test for the diagnosis of his disease?

Options:
  B-Scan ultrasound
  Visual fields
✓ Optical coherence tomography
  Color vision test
  Visual acuity

Explanation:
Difficulty recognizing faces (prosopagnosia) can be related to central visual processing issues, and given the fundus examination showing macular disturbance, conditions affecting the macula are suspected. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of the macula, making it the most appropriate test for detailed diagnosis of various retinal and macular diseases that could affect central vision.

================================================================================
Question 2 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old patient is diagnosed with mature cataract and no view of retina. What investigation will you order first to evaluate the retina and vitreous in such patient?

Options:
  MRI
  CT scan
✓ B-Scan U/S
  OCT
  Tonometery

Explanation:
In a patient with a mature cataract where the view of the retina is obscured, B-scan ultrasonography (U/S) is the standard and first-line investigation. It allows for the visualization and assessment of the retina and vitreous to rule out any posterior segment pathology, such as retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage, before proceeding with cataract surgery.

================================================================================
Question 3 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with sudden painless loss of vision and no fundal view was possible. Which of the investigation is helpful to see the retina

Options:
  A-Scan
✓ B- Scan
  Keratometry
  Indirect ophthalmoscopy
  Pachymetry

Explanation:
When there is sudden painless loss of vision and the fundus cannot be visualized (e.g., due to dense vitreous hemorrhage, mature cataract, or other opaque media), B-scan ultrasonography is the appropriate investigation to evaluate the retina and vitreous to determine the cause of vision loss.

================================================================================
Question 4 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old patient presented with decrease vision in both eye. The patient le uncontrolled diabetic from the last 12 years. On examination you suspected diabetic macular edema. Which investigation modality can better diagnose the macular edema?

Options:
  B Scan
  Fundus autofluorescence
  Fundus fluorescence angiography
✓ Optical coherence tomograph
  Visual fields

Explanation:
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the preferred investigation modality for better diagnosing and quantifying macular edema, especially in diabetic patients. It provides detailed cross-sectional views of the retina, allowing for precise assessment of retinal thickness and fluid accumulation within the macula.

================================================================================
Question 5 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old male patient presents with facial palsy for last 9 months. On examination he has exposure keratopathy, What will be your 1" line of treatment?

Options:
✓ Frequent topical lubricants
  Permanent Lateral tarsorrhapy
  Amniotic membrane graft
  Taping at night
  Temporary Glue tarsorrhapy

Explanation:
In a patient with facial palsy leading to lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy, the immediate and most crucial first-line treatment is to protect the cornea from drying and damage. Frequent topical lubricants (artificial tears and lubricating ointments) are essential to maintain corneal hydration and prevent complications like corneal ulceration.

================================================================================
Question 6 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 34 years male patient was subjected to face burn with strong acid, two months later he presents with watering and inability to close his left eye. The explanation of this may be?

Options:
  Machanical ectropion
✓ Cicatricial ectropion
  Ocular cicatricial phamphigoid
  Paralytic ectropion
  Corneal erosion

Explanation:
A severe face burn with strong acid can lead to significant scarring and contraction of the eyelid skin. This cicatricial change can pull the eyelid margin outwards, resulting in cicatricial ectropion, which causes lagophthalmos (inability to close the eye) and watering.

================================================================================
Question 7 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 years old female presents with slowly growing mass on upper lid. On histological examination mass shows pale foamy vacuolated lipid-containing hyperchromatic nuclei. What is most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Squamous cell carcinoma
  Basal cell carcinoma
✓ Sebaceous gland carcinoma
  Malignant melanoma
  KAPOSI sarcoma

Explanation:
The histological findings of pale, foamy, vacuolated, lipid-containing cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, especially in a slowly growing mass on the upper eyelid of an elderly patient, are highly characteristic of sebaceous gland carcinoma. This aggressive tumor has a predilection for the upper eyelid because of the higher density of meibomian glands.

================================================================================
Question 8 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 1 years old male child is brought to you with complaint of drooping of right eyelid since birth. Parents say that his eye is half open during sleep as well. There is absent lid crease and poor levator function. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Amblyopia
  Aponeurotic Ptosis
✓ Congenital Ptosis
  Pseudoptosis
  Senile Ptosis

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a drooping eyelid present since birth, associated with poor levator muscle function (eye remaining half open during sleep) and an absent lid crease, is characteristic of congenital ptosis. This is typically due to a developmental dystrophy of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle.

================================================================================
Question 9 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2 years old male child is brought to you with complaint of drooping of right eyelid since birth. Parents say that his eye is half open during sleep as well. There is absent lid crease amblyopia and poor levator function. Which procedure you will perform in this patient?

Options:
  Fasanella Servat
  Muller resection
  Levator resection
✓ Permanent Brow Suspension
  Temporary Brow Suspension

Explanation:
For congenital ptosis with poor levator muscle function (typically less than 4-5 mm), as indicated by the 'half open during sleep' and 'poor levator function,' levator resection alone may be insufficient. In such cases, a permanent brow suspension (frontalis suspension) procedure is often performed to connect the eyelid to the frontalis muscle, allowing the child to lift the eyelid by raising their eyebrow. The presence of amblyopia further emphasizes the need for early and effective surgical correction of ptosis to clear the visual axis.

================================================================================
Question 10 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
25 years old female had a trauma to the right lower lid Now she is unable to close the right eye fully and the lower eyelid margin is rotated outward and there is scar mark 2mm below the lower eyelid. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Congenital ectropion
✓ Cicatricial ectropion
  Paralytic ectroipion
  Senile ectropion
  Traumatic entropion

Explanation:
The history of trauma leading to a scar below the right lower eyelid, which has caused the eyelid margin to rotate outward (ectropion) and an inability to fully close the eye, is characteristic of cicatricial ectropion. This type of ectropion is caused by the contraction of scar tissue.

================================================================================
Question 11 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
20 years old male presented with painful swelling on the upper eyelid for the last two weeks. Lesion is red and edematous and tender to touch What's the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Chalazion
  Lipoma
✓ Stye
  Dermoid cyst
  Traumatic entropion

Explanation:
A painful, red, edematous, and tender swelling on the eyelid, especially if acute or subacute (two weeks), is the classic presentation of a stye (hordeolum externum or internum). A stye is an acute suppurative infection of an eyelid gland.

================================================================================
Question 12 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
40 years old female had a history of bells palsy six months ago and then she was unable to open her left eye Now she is able to open her eye but eye is red and watery and lower eye lid is rotated outwards. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Congenital ectropion
  Cicatrical ectropion
✓ Paralytic ectropion
  Senile ectropion
  Traumatic entropion

Explanation:
A history of Bell's palsy (facial nerve paralysis) leading to inability to close the eye (lagophthalmos) and now the lower eyelid rotated outwards (ectropion) with a red and watery eye (exposure keratopathy) is characteristic of paralytic ectropion. The facial nerve innervates the orbicularis oculi muscle, which is essential for eyelid closure and proper lid positioning.

================================================================================
Question 13 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16 year old patient have chronic irritation itching and mild photophobia. on examination he has small ulcer and redness on lid margine what is yours diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Staphylo-coccal blephritis
  Squamous blephritis
  Seborrheic blephritis
  Posterior blephritis
  Mixed blephritis

Explanation:
The symptoms of chronic irritation, itching, redness on the lid margin, and small ulcers associated with the lash follicles are characteristic of staphylococcal blepharitis (ulcerative anterior blepharitis). *Staphylococcus* species are the most common bacterial cause of this condition.

================================================================================
Question 14 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the gold standard treatment of orbital dermoid cyst?

Options:
  Observation
  Aspiration
  Intra- lesional triamcinolone injection
  Antibiotic
✓ Surgical removal in toto

Explanation:
Orbital dermoid cysts are benign congenital lesions. The gold standard treatment is complete surgical excision (*in toto*, meaning entirely in one piece) without rupturing the cyst. This prevents recurrence and avoids inflammatory reactions from the spillage of cyst contents.

================================================================================
Question 15 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old lady having an ulcer on the lower lid from last 2 years. This lesion has a central ulceration with raised border , What is yours diagnosis?

Options:
  Sebaceous glands carcinoma
  Squamous cell carcinoma
✓ Basal cell carcinoma
  Keratoacanthoma.
  Pyogenic granuloma

Explanation:
A chronic (2 years), non-healing ulcer on the lower eyelid with raised, pearly borders and a central ulceration is highly suggestive of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which is the most common malignant tumor of the eyelid.

================================================================================
Question 16 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is the best initial treatment of chalazion?

Options:
✓ Hot compression
  Dark glasses
  Triamcinolone
  Antibiotic
  Surgery

Explanation:
The best initial treatment for a chalazion is conservative management, which primarily involves frequent application of warm compresses (hot compression) and eyelid massage. This helps to liquefy the inspissated meibomian gland secretions and promote drainage.

================================================================================
Question 17 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
11 months old infant presents with watering right eye since birth. On pressing lacrimal sac causes regurgitation of mucopus material. What is the appropriate treatment option?

Options:
  Dacryocystorhinostomy
✓ Probing with syringing
  Massage with antibiotics up to age of 6 months
  Dacryocystectomy
  Probing

Explanation:
For congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (dacryostenosis) that persists beyond 6-9 months of age (or when conservative management with massage and antibiotics has failed), lacrimal duct probing with syringing is the appropriate next step. It aims to open the membrane obstruction at the distal end of the nasolacrimal duct.

================================================================================
Question 18 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 47 years old male presents with watery left eye. On examination she has red swelling over medial canthus, which is tender on palpation What is your diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Acute dacryocystitis
  Chronic dacryocystitis
  Sebaceous gland carcinoma
  Punctal stenosis

Explanation:
A red, tender swelling over the medial canthus, accompanied by epiphora (watery eye), is the classic presentation of acute dacryocystitis. This is an acute infection of the lacrimal sac, usually due to obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct.

================================================================================
Question 19 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
75 years old male labourer presented with watering and mucopurulent discharge for the last two years. He had medial canthal swelling as well What could be the treatment for this patient?

Options:
  Probing
  Syringing
✓ Dacryocystectomy
  Incision and drainage
  Dacryocystectomy

Explanation:
For chronic dacryocystitis in an elderly patient, the definitive surgical treatment is usually dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), which creates a new drainage pathway. However, DCR is not listed as a unique option. Dacryocystectomy (removal of the lacrimal sac) is an alternative surgical treatment, particularly for older patients or those unfit for DCR, although it results in persistent epiphora. Given the options with 'Dacryocystectomy' repeated, it is the intended answer for a surgical approach to chronic sac issues, as probing/syringing are less definitive for chronic adult obstruction and incision/drainage is for acute abscess management.

================================================================================
Question 20 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26 years old female presents with mucopurulent discharge and visual impairment for the last two months She used Tobramycin eye drops for one month with no improvement. On examination there are follicles/papillae on the upper tarsal conjunctiva of both eyes and mild superficial keratitis. She gives history of same condition of her hushand and two younger children. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Trachoma
  VKC
  Bacterial conjunctivitis
  Viral conjunctivitis
  Hypersensitivity to topical medication

Explanation:
The chronic mucopurulent discharge, visual impairment, presence of follicles and papillae on the upper tarsal conjunctiva, mild superficial keratitis, and the familial clustering of similar symptoms are all classic signs of trachoma, a chronic follicular conjunctivitis caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis*.

================================================================================
Question 21 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16 year female using some drug prescribed my GP in periphery for spring catarrh for :last 5 years Now she presents with posterior subcapsular cataract both eye. Which drug causes such condition?

Options:
  Topical Sodium Chromo gylcate
  Topical Ciclosporine
✓ Topical Steroids
  Topical Anti histamine
  Topical amibiotic

Explanation:
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (spring catarrh) is often treated with topical steroids for symptomatic relief of severe inflammation. However, long-term use of topical corticosteroids is a well-known risk factor for the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts, as well as glaucoma.

================================================================================
Question 22 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year former presents with progressive recurrent pterygium of right eye. He has past history of pterygium excision in same eye. Now what will be your treatment option?

Options:
  Leave it as
  Bare scleral excision
  Excision with mitomycin C
✓ Excision with auto conjunctival graft
  Excision with cryo

Explanation:
For recurrent pterygium, especially after a previous excision, simply excising it again has a high recurrence rate. The most effective treatment to reduce recurrence is excision combined with conjunctival autografting (taking a piece of healthy conjunctiva from the same eye and transplanting it to the bare sclera). Mitomycin C (MMC) can also be used as an adjunct.

================================================================================
Question 23 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 year old male child is brought to you with complaint of severe itching that in exacerbated at night You examine him and find dirty grey eyes. He is also not able to open eyes in light. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  AKC
  Anterior Uveitis
  Conjunctivitis
  Keratitis
✓ VKC

Explanation:
The severe itching (exacerbated at night), photophobia (unable to open eyes in light), and the presence of 'dirty grey eyes' (which can describe limbal papillae or other features of severe allergic inflammation) in a child are classic symptoms of Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). This chronic, bilateral allergic conjunctivitis is often associated with atopy and seasonal recurrence.

================================================================================
Question 24 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old Labourer by profession comes to you with a fleshy growth encroaching upon cornea. His vision is ase affected. You diagnose him and advise multiple treatment options. Which of the following is the best management plan?

Options:
  Bare sclera technique
  Beta radiation
✓ Conjunctival autograft
  Inferior fornix rotation technique
  MMC

Explanation:
For symptomatic pterygium (a fleshy growth on the conjunctiva encroaching onto the cornea, affecting vision), surgical excision is the treatment. The best management plan to prevent recurrence, particularly after excision, is the use of a conjunctival autograft, where a piece of healthy conjunctiva is transplanted to the bare sclera after pterygium removal.

================================================================================
Question 25 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old farmer by profession comes to you with a fleshy growth encroaching upon cornea. His vision is also affected. You diagnose him as a case of pterygium and advise him surgery. Which of the following is not a feature of pterygium?

Options:
  Astigmatism
  Conjunctival Involvement
  Cosmetic Blemish
  Corneal Involvement
✓ UV exposure

Explanation:
Pterygium is a triangular fleshy growth of the conjunctiva that encroaches onto the cornea. It can cause corneal involvement, conjunctival involvement, astigmatism, and cosmetic blemish. UV exposure is a major *risk factor* for the development of pterygium, but it is not a *feature* of the lesion itself.

================================================================================
Question 26 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young male of 22 years, present with gradual decrease of visual activity in both eyes and frequent change of refractive error on retinoscopy there was high irregular astigmatism. Give likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Keratoglobus
✓ Keratoconus
  Buphthalmos
  Terrien marginal degeneration
  Pellucid marginal degeneration

Explanation:
Progressive decrease in vision, frequent changes in prescription (especially myopic astigmatism), and high irregular astigmatism in a young adult are hallmark features of keratoconus, a progressive ectatic corneal disorder.

================================================================================
Question 27 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 21 years old patient presents with gradual painless blurred vision in right eye which is associated with haloes around lights for the last two weeks. On examination there is central zone of stromal oedema with keratic precipitates underlying the corneal oedema along with reduced corneal sensation. You diagnosed patient as disciform keratitis. What will be best treatment option for this patient?

Options:
✓ Topical antiviral + Topical steroids
  Topical antiviral + Topical antibiotics
  Topical antiviral + Topical cycloplegics
  Topical antibiotics + Topical steroids + cycloplegics
  Topical antibiotics + Topical cycloplegics

Explanation:
Disciform keratitis is an immune-mediated reaction to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) antigens in the corneal stroma. The mainstay of treatment is topical corticosteroids to suppress the immune response/inflammation, always covered by topical antivirals to prevent reactivation of active viral replication (dendritic keratitis).

================================================================================
Question 28 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old farmer presents with a history of trauma to the left eye with a leaf 5 days ago now he presents with pain, photophobia and redness of the eye. On examination he has grey white lesion 'having fluffy margins with hypopyon. What would be the most likely pathology?

Options:
  Anterior uveitis
  Bacterial Conjunctivitis
✓ Fungal keratitis
  Viral keratitis
  Bacterial keratitis

Explanation:
The history of trauma with vegetative matter (leaf) in a farmer, followed by a corneal ulcer with 'fluffy margins' (feathery edges), satellite lesions (often implied), and hypopyon, is highly characteristic of fungal keratitis.

================================================================================
Question 29 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old man presented in OPD with history of agricultural trauma 3 days back on examination he has central corneal defect with fluffy margins along with hypopyon. Corneal defect stains with fluorescein. How you will manage this patient.

Options:
  Systemic anti biotics, systemic anti-fungal and systemic steroids
  Topical antibiotics, topical anti-fungal, topical cycloplegics and systemic antibiotics
✓ Topical anti-fungal, topical antibiotics, topical cycloplegics and systemic anti-fungal
  Topical antibiotics, Topical anti-fungal, topical cycloplegics. And systemic steroids
  Topical steroids, topical anti-fungal, topical cycloplegics and systemic steroids

Explanation:
For suspected fungal keratitis (agricultural trauma, fluffy margins), the primary treatment is topical antifungals. Cycloplegics are used for pain and to prevent synechiae. Broad-spectrum topical antibiotics are often added to cover bacterial coinfection. Systemic antifungals may be added for severe cases. Steroids are generally contraindicated in the active phase of fungal keratitis as they can worsen the infection.

================================================================================
Question 30 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 years female presents with advanced keratoconus in one eye. What will be best treatment option for this patient?

Options:
  Spectacles
  Rigid contact lenses
  Corneal cross linkage
  Eximer laser
✓ Penetrating keratoplasty

Explanation:
In 'advanced' keratoconus, where corneal scarring is present or the cone is too steep for contact lenses to fit or correct vision adequately, surgical intervention is required. Penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant) or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is the standard treatment for restoring vision in advanced cases. Cross-linking is for progression, not restoring vision in advanced cases. Spectacles and contacts often fail in advanced disease.

================================================================================
Question 31 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years female presents with pain redness and decreased vision left eye from last 4 days on examination she has central corneal epithelial defect with hypopyon. Which duotherapy is recommended for its treatment?

Options:
  Fortified cephalosporin and fluoroquinolones
✓ Fortified cephalosporin and aminoglycoside
  Fortified aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolones
  Fortified aminoglycoside and penicillin
  Fortified macrolides and fluoroquinolones

Explanation:
For severe bacterial corneal ulcers (suggested by hypopyon), broad-spectrum coverage is essential. The standard 'duotherapy' often involves fortified antibiotics to cover both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. A common regimen is a fortified cephalosporin (e.g., cefazolin for Gram-positives) and a fortified aminoglycoside (e.g., tobramycin or gentamicin for Gram-negatives).

================================================================================
Question 32 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old patient presents with 2 days history of painful rash on right side of fore head extending down to eyelids. A vesicular skin lesion is also seen near tip of nose. Which of the following is appropriate treatment option?

Options:
  Topical Acyclovir ointment 8 times a day
✓ Oral acyclovir 800mg 5 times a day for 10 days
  Oral acyclovir 400mg 2 times a day for 10 days
  Oral acyclovir 800mg 2 times a day for 10 days
  Oral acyciovir 400mg 5 times a day for 10 days

Explanation:
The patient has Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO), indicated by the painful dermatomal rash involving the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and the Hutchinson's sign (lesion on the tip of the nose). The standard antiviral treatment for HZO to reduce complications and post-herpetic neuralgia is high-dose oral acyclovir: 800 mg 5 times daily for 7-10 days.

================================================================================
Question 33 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old lady presents with watering, blurring of vision and discomfort Right Eye for the last six days. On examination there are linear branching corneal epithelial defects. The patient gives history of fever and mild trauma he with her son's finger two weeks back. She used tobramycin eye drops with no improvement. Her VA RE is 6/36 and L/E 6/6 what is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Corneal abrasion
  Corneal ulcer
✓ Herpes simplex keratitis
  Herpes zoster keratitis
  Cornnal erosion

Explanation:
A linear branching corneal epithelial defect is the classic description of a dendritic ulcer, which is pathognomonic for Herpes Simplex Keratitis (epithelial type). The history of fever (stressor) or mild trauma can trigger reactivation. The lack of response to antibiotics further supports a viral etiology.

================================================================================
Question 34 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 72 years old male presents with vesicular rash around her left eye. The left eye is red with some degree of photophobia, presumptive diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus made how will you treat this patient ?

Options:
  Oral acyclovir and topical acyclovir
  Intravenous acyclovir and topical acyclovir
  Oral famcyclovir and topical acyclovir
✓ Oral acyclovir
  Topical acyclovir

Explanation:
Systemic antiviral therapy is the mainstay of treatment for Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO). Oral acyclovir (800mg 5x/day), valacyclovir, or famciclovir are used to reduce viral shedding, pain, and ocular complications. Topical antivirals are generally not effective for the skin rash or the systemic viral load and are adjunctive at best for specific corneal involvement, but oral therapy is the primary requirement. Among the options, oral acyclovir is the standard systemic treatment.

================================================================================
Question 35 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The mother of a one and a half year old child gives history of a white reflex from one eye for the past 1 month. On computed tomography scan of the orbit there is calcification seen within the globe. The most bikely diagnosis is?

Options:
  Congenital cataract
✓ Retinoblastoma
  Endophthalmitis
  Coats disease
  pt.-Ipv (Typo in source, likely meant Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous PHPV)

Explanation:
Leukocoria (white reflex) in a young child (1.5 years) combined with the finding of intraocular calcification on CT scan is highly diagnostic of Retinoblastoma. Calcification is a hallmark feature of retinoblastoma and helps distinguish it from other causes of leukocoria like Coats disease or PHPV.

================================================================================
Question 36 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old woman presented with the complaint of decreased far vision. According to her she was first sorprised with good near vision as she was now able to read Quran Pak without near glasses but her joy was for just lew weeks at now she can't see few meters far her vision is RE 6/60 and LE Counting fingers whats the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Posterior Subcapsular Cataract
  Glaucoma
✓ Nuclear Cataract
  Polar Cataract
  Cortical Cataract

Explanation:
The phenomenon of improved near vision in an elderly presbyopic patient (able to read without glasses), known as 'second sight,' is caused by myopic shift. This myopic shift is characteristic of nuclear sclerosis (nuclear cataract) due to the increased refractive index of the hardening nucleus.

================================================================================
Question 37 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old man presented with painless mild decrease of vision who underwent left eye phacoemulsification 6 weeks ago, it was complication free surgery. Pre op vision was 6/60 and on first post op day it was 6/12 which improved to 6/ 6 after one week post op It was good vision for the next four weeks but now he has again 6/12 vision. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Endophthalmitis
✓ Cystoid Muscular Edema
  PCO
  RD
  Astigmatism

Explanation:
Painless decrease in vision occurring a few weeks (typically 4-12 weeks) after uneventful cataract surgery is classic for Cystoid Macular Edema (CME), also known as Irvine-Gass syndrome. The vision initially improves and then declines.

================================================================================
Question 38 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old male patient had history of cataract surgery in the camp one week ago His vision is 6/36 in the operated eye with pinhole vision becomes 6/9. On slitlamp examination you see four interrupted very tight stitches causing identification of peripheral cornea . cornea is clear lens in place and good fundus view. what's the cause of decrease of vision in this patient P

Options:
  Wound dehiscence
  Infection
  Biometry error
✓ With the rule astigmatism.
  Against the rule astigmatism

Explanation:
Tight sutures in the superior cornea (typical for manual cataract surgery incisions) steepen the vertical meridian of the cornea. This results in 'With-The-Rule' (WTR) astigmatism (vertical meridian steeper than horizontal). The improvement with pinhole suggests a refractive cause.

================================================================================
Question 39 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old man presented with decreased vision in the outdoor He had phacoemulsification with foldable iol implant two years back he was alright for the two years but now his vision is gradually decreased. On examination his Vision in affected eye is 6/24. His fundus details though hazy appear normal. On retroillumination there are pearl like opacities in posterior chansber of anterior segment What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Corneal edema
  Endophthalmitis
✓ PCO
  PCR
  RD

Explanation:
Gradual decrease in vision months to years after cataract surgery, associated with 'pearl-like opacities' seen on retroillumination (Elschnig pearls), is characteristic of Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO), also known as secondary cataract or after-cataract.

================================================================================
Question 40 (GMC - 2023)

Question:
A 60 years old female patient is diagnosed with mature cataract Her vision in the affected eye is hand movements. Her cornea is also not very healthy. Which of the following is the best procedure for restoration of her vision?

Options:
  FCCE
  ICCE
  Phaco with low power
  Phaco with high power
✓ Small incision cataract surgery

Explanation:
In the presence of a compromised cornea ('not very healthy,' likely implying endothelial issues) and a hard/mature cataract, Phacoemulsification carries a higher risk of corneal decompensation due to the ultrasound energy required. Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) is a safer alternative as it is manual, uses no ultrasound energy, and is very effective for mature cataracts, protecting the endothelium better than high-power phaco.

================================================================================
Question 41 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old female patient underwent phaco for her left white cataract, Which of the following is not a post op complication of cataract surgery?

Options:
  Corneal Striations
  PCO
✓ PCR
  RD
  Refractive Surprise

Explanation:
PCR (Posterior Capsular Rupture) is an *intraoperative* complication that occurs during the surgery itself. Corneal striations, PCO (Posterior Capsular Opacification), RD (Retinal Detachment), and Refractive Surprise are all potential *postoperative* complications.

================================================================================
Question 42 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2 year old female child is brought to you with complaint of white pupil and decrease of vision You examine her and diagnose her as a case of congenital cataract. Which one is the most common presentation?

Options:
  Blue Dot
✓ Eamellar
  Nuclear
  Polar
  Sutural

Explanation:
Lamellar (or Zonular) cataract is the most common type of congenital cataract presenting with visual impairment. It affects a specific layer or zone of the lens.

================================================================================
Question 43 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old man presented with right eye cataract. You performed his Biometry and calculated his IOL which is the most important factor in IOL calculation

Options:
  A constant
✓ Axial Length
  Bscan
  Keratoetry
  Tonometry

Explanation:
Axial length is the most critical factor in IOL power calculation. A small error in measuring axial length (e.g., 1 mm) can result in a significant refractive error (approx. 2.5 - 3 Diopters) postoperatively, much more than errors in keratometry.

================================================================================
Question 44 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 year old woman presented with gradual decrease of vision for the last few years in the right eye She first started to feel it when she bumped into the objects. Her vision is 6/12 OD and 6/6 OD IOP is 28mmhg OD and 16mmhg OS. There is a red birth mark around the right eye and deep anterior chamber Fundus examination reveals CD 0.7 OD and 0.40S whats the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  POAG
  PACG
✓ Sec OAG
  Sec ACG
  Congenital Glaucoma

Explanation:
The presence of a 'red birthmark around the eye' (Port-Wine Stain/Nevus Flammeus) suggests Sturge-Weber Syndrome. This condition is associated with ipsilateral glaucoma. Given the deep anterior chamber, open angle on gonioscopy (implied by deep AC and context), and raised IOP, it is a Secondary Open Angle Glaucoma (associated with episcleral venous pressure elevation or angle anomalies).

================================================================================
Question 45 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year-old man presented with gradual decrease of vision for the last few months. According to him this vision in the right eye is more decreased as compared to the left eye He first started to feel it when he bumped into the objects His vision is 6/12 00 and 6/6 OD JOP is 19mmhg OD and 16mmhg OS. There is a deep anterior chamber and on fundus examination CD 0.6 OD and 0.50S. The most likely next investigatiom to reach the diagnosis is?

Options:
  Visual Fields and OCT Optic dist
  Visual Fields and HRT
  Visual Fields and CCT
  OCT Optic disc and HRT
✓ CCT and Gonio

Explanation:
Central Corneal Thickness (CCT) is crucial because thin corneas can lead to underestimation of IOP (making 'normal' pressure glaucoma possibly a high pressure one masked by thin cornea) and is an independent risk factor. Gonioscopy is essential to determine if the angle is open or closed, which is fundamental for classification and management. While fields/OCT assess damage, confirming the type (open vs closed) and true pressure risk (pachymetry) are vital diagnostic steps.

================================================================================
Question 46 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old man presented with gradual decrease of vision for the last few months. According to him his vision in the right eye is more decreased as compared to the left eye His vision is 6/12 RE and 6/9 LE IOP is 24mmhg RE and 18mmhg LE CCT central corneal thickness is 522umRE and 530umLE Gonio shows open angle both eyes CD 0.6RE and 0.4LE Visual fields and OCT optic disc also shows early glaucomatous changes. Which of the following drug will you start?

Options:
  Alpha 2 agonist
  Beta blocker
  Calcium channel blocker
✓ Prostaglandin analogues
  Pilocarpine

Explanation:
Prostaglandin analogues (e.g., Latanoprost) are the first-line medical therapy for Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) due to their high efficacy in lowering IOP, once-daily dosing, and relatively safe systemic side effect profile.

================================================================================
Question 47 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year old man is a newly diagnosed patient of open angle glaucoma He is a poor person labourer by profession. His IOP is 25mmHg in RE and 23mmHg in LE Which drug you should start to keep IOP under control in this particular patient?

Options:
  Alpha 2 agonist
✓ Beta blocker
  Calcium channel blocker
  Prostaglandin analogues
  Pilocarpine

Explanation:
While prostaglandin analogues are first-line, they can be expensive. For a 'poor person labourer,' cost is a significant factor in compliance. Beta-blockers (e.g., Timolol) are effective, widely available, and significantly cheaper than prostaglandins, making them a suitable cost-effective first-line choice in resource-limited settings.

================================================================================
Question 48 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old woman presented with painful decrease of vision in the right eye. He had a history of vein occlusion in the same eye four months ago. On examination his vision is CF and IOP 44mming and on slitlamp vessels are appreciated at 90 clock on the iris in RE. Gonioscopy reveal closed angle What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Alpha 2 agonist
  Beta blocker
  Calcium channel blocker
  Prostaglandin analogues
  Pilocarpine

Explanation:
The options provided are drug classes, but the question asks for a diagnosis. The clinical picture—history of CRVO ('90-day glaucoma'), rubeosis iridis (vessels on iris), high IOP, and angle closure (likely synechial)—is classic for Neovascular Glaucoma. If the question implies treatment, none of these alone is definitive for NVG without addressing ischemia (PRP/Anti-VEGF), but the question asks for diagnosis. The provided options are likely mismatched.

================================================================================
Question 49 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old woman presented with painful decrease of vision in the left eye. She is having uncontrolled DM for the last 20 years. On examination his vision is CF and IOP 44mmHg and on slitiamp vessels are appreciated at 9 0 clock on the iris in LE Gonioscopy reveal closed angle. On fundoscopy fundal view is hazy but you see vitreous haemorrhage and neovessels on optic disc. Which of the following treatment option is not recommended in its management?

Options:
  Atropine
  Aqueous suppressants
  Pars Plana Vitrectomy
  Photocoagulation
✓ Pilocarpine

Explanation:
In Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG), the angle is closed by a fibrovascular membrane (rubeosis). Pilocarpine is contraindicated because it can increase inflammation, worsen the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier, and is ineffective or harmful in synechial angle closure. Atropine (cycloplegic) is used to reduce pain and inflammation. Treatment focuses on reducing IOP (aqueous suppressants) and treating retinal ischemia (PRP/Anti-VEGF/Vitrectomy).

================================================================================
Question 50 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old woman presented with decrease of vision in the left eye. On examination his vision is CF and IOP 28mmHg and on slittamp white fibrillary material can be appreciated on the lens capsule.

Options:
  Angie Recession Glaucoma
  Neovascular Glaucoma
  Pigmentary Glaucoma
✓ Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome
  True Exfoliation Syndrome

Explanation:
The presence of 'white fibrillary material' (dandruff-like) on the lens capsule and in the angle is pathognomonic for Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (PEX). This material clogs the trabecular meshwork, leading to Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma.

================================================================================
Question 51 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old man presented with complaint of painful decrease of vision in right eye for last one week. According to him, he had episode of vein occlusion one year back in the same eye and vision was 6/60 after that. Now it is counting fingers. SL examination shows blood vessels on the iris with corneal edema and red watery eye. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Angle closure glaucoma
  Pigmentary glaucoma
  Lens induced glaucoma
  Inflammatory glaucoma
✓ Neovascular Glaucoma

Explanation:
History of retinal vein occlusion, followed by the development of rubeosis iridis (blood vessels on the iris) and painful high IOP (indicated by corneal edema), is the classic presentation of Neovascular Glaucoma.

================================================================================

Options:
  Vogt-Koyanagi Harada Syndrome
  Lyme disese
  Sarcoidosis
✓ Sympathetic Ophthalmitis.
  Chronic uveitis

Explanation:
Sympathetic Ophthalmitis is a bilateral granulomatous panuveitis that occurs after penetrating trauma to one eye (the exciting eye), leading to inflammation in the fellow eye (the sympathizing eye).

================================================================================
Question 54 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old man presentest an emergency with complaints of painful decrease on vision for two days He had history of cataract surgery one week ago. On examination he had red swollen left eye, corneal edema, pus in the anterior chamber and poor fundus glow. His vision is 6/6 OD and CF OS. What's the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Acute Elephthalmitis (Endophthalmitis)
  Chronic Endophthalmitis
  Acute Keratins (Keratitis)
  Acute anterior Uveitis
  Acute congestive glaucoma

Explanation:
Acute postoperative endophthalmitis typically presents within days to weeks of surgery with pain, redness, hypopyon (pus in AC), and vitreous inflammation (poor fundus glow).

================================================================================
Question 55 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 56 years old patient's presented with sudden loss of vision in his left eye associated with floaters O/E anterior segment was normal, fundus showed vitreous hemorrhage in that eye. All of the following are risk factors for vitreous hemorrhago except?

Options:
  Diabetes
  Retinal vein occlusion
✓ Glaucoma
  Trauma
  Eales disease

Explanation:
Vitreous hemorrhage is caused by bleeding from retinal vessels (e.g., in PDR, CRVO, Eales disease) or trauma. Glaucoma itself does not typically cause vitreous hemorrhage unless it is neovascular glaucoma (secondary to ischemia), but primary glaucoma is not a direct cause.

================================================================================
Question 56 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 year old woman presented with painful decrease of vision in the left eye. She is having uncontrolled DM for the last 20 years. On examination his vision is CF and IOP 44mmHg and on slitlamp vessels are appreciated at 9 0 clock on the iris in LE. Gonioscopy reveal closed angle On fundoscopy fundal view is hazy but you see vitreous haemorrhage aml neovessels on optic disc. What is the most likely cause of this condition?

Options:
  Carotic Cavernous Fistula
  CRVO
  Ocular ischemic Syndrome
✓ Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
  Tumor in the Eye

Explanation:
The patient has signs of Neovascular Glaucoma (rubeosis, high IOP). The underlying cause is retinal ischemia. Given the history of uncontrolled Diabetes for 20 years and findings of neovessels on the disc and vitreous hemorrhage, Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) is the primary cause.

================================================================================
Question 57 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

================================================================================
Question 77 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young boy was presented in the eye clinic with blunt trauma to his left eye with a ball. There was a superficial corneal ulcer involving the inferotemporal quadrant of the cornea. Which of the following is the best management for this young boy?

Options:
  Use of antibiotic eye drops
✓ Use of antibiotic eye ointment
  Bandaged contact lens
  Use of antibiotic and eye patching
  No management required and it will heal by itself

Explanation:
For a traumatic corneal abrasion/ulcer, antibiotic ointment (e.g., chloramphenicol) provides lubrication and prophylaxis. Patching is sometimes used but not always 'best' compared to just ointment/drops.

================================================================================
Question 78 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
12 years old girl is brought to the eye emergency with history of blunt trauma to the RE with kids pellet gun.

  Anti-Glaucoma drops
  Bed Rest
  Cyclopentolate drops
  Steroid drops

Explanation:
In blunt trauma with hyphema (blood in AC) but intact epithelium, antibiotics are not strictly necessary unless there's a risk of infection (open wound). Steroids, cycloplegics, bed rest, and pressure lowering agents are standard hyphema management. Antibiotics are least critical here if globe is intact.

================================================================================
Question 79 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following does not require emergency ophthalmic treatment?

Options:
  Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma
  Acute Anterior Uveitis
  Giant Cell Arteritis
  Keratitis

================================================================================

Question:
A 6 years male child is brought to the outdoor with complaints of decrease of vision while studying from white hoard in school Parents also noticed that child stands, very close to the television while watching cartoons. You performs retinoscopy anal there is streak moving in opposite directions What's the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Astigmatism
  Emmetropia
  Hyperopia
✓ Myopia
  Strabismus

Explanation:
Difficulty with distance vision (school board) and sitting close to TV are signs of myopia. 'Against' motion (opposite direction) on retinoscopy (assuming a plane mirror effect at working distance) typically indicates Myopia > 1.50 D.

================================================================================
Question 81 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 year old female comes to the outdoor with complaints of frontal headache and decrease of vision while reading and sewing She can see perfectly fine at distance What is the mov likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Astigmatism
  Emmetropia
✓ Hyperopia
  Myopia
  Presbyopia

Explanation:
Difficulty with near tasks (reading/sewing) and headaches (asthenopia) with clear distance vision in a 40-year-old could be early Presbyopia or latent Hyperopia. Given the headache component and age, Hyperopia decompensating or early presbyopia are key. Since Presbyopia is strictly age-related loss of accommodation and Hyperopia is a refractive error causing similar near symptoms often earlier, Hyperopia fits well if she needs accommodation for distance too but hides it. However, the classic near-vision difficulty at 40 is Presbyopia.

Question:
You perform a retinoscopy of a patient complaining of decrease of vision. On retinoscopy the streaks moved with the movement Which of the following is most likely false?

Options:
  Astigmatism
  Emmetropia
  Hyperopia

Options:
  B-Scan ultrasonography
  Fundus autofluorescence
  Fundus Fluorescein angiography
✓ Optical coherence tomography
  Pachymetry

Explanation:
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the gold standard for diagnosing, quantifying, and monitoring diabetic macular edema. It provides high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retinal layers, allowing for precise measurement of retinal thickness and detection of intraretinal fluid, which is essential for guiding treatment.

================================================================================
Question 171 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 75 years old farmer has a lesion on the Tower lid on the medial side for a few years There is a history of recurrent bleeding. On roiled margins with examination there surface telangiectasia. After performing biopsy the histology report is positive for BCC. What is the most appropriate treatment for a biopsy positive basal cell carcinoma of the lower eyelid?

Options:
  Cryotherapy to the cancer and margins
  Local antimetabolite treatment
  Radiations with 2500 rads to the lesion and margins
✓ Excision with frozen section control of margins
  Cautery to the margins

Explanation:
For biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the eyelid, the most appropriate and effective treatment is complete surgical excision with clear margin control. Techniques like frozen section control (or Mohs micrographic surgery) are preferred as they allow for immediate microscopic examination of surgical margins, ensuring complete tumor removal while preserving maximum healthy tissue, which is crucial for eyelid reconstruction.

================================================================================
Question 172 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12 years old female child is brought by the mother to the eye OPD for the complaint of drooping of the right upper eyelid since birth. The ophthalmologist diagnosed her as a case of right congenital ptosis. Which of the following best explains why when a ptotic lid is lifted the contralateral lid falls?

Options:
  Inhibition of Mullerls muscle
  Sherrington's law of reciprocal innervation
  Relaxation of the Frontalis muscle
✓ Hering's law of equal innervation
  Relaxation of Muller's muscle

Explanation:
Hering's law of equal innervation states that the levator muscles of both eyelids receive equal and simultaneous innervation. In cases of unilateral ptosis, the brain compensates by sending increased innervation to both levators. When the ptotic lid is surgically corrected or manually lifted, this compensatory excess innervation to the contralateral levator is unmasked, causing the contralateral (previously normal) eyelid to drop.

================================================================================
Question 173 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old female presents with inward rolling of the right lower eyelid. There is foreign body sensation and watering due to constant rubbing of the eyelashes against the cornea. Which of the following factors is least likely to contribute to the development of entropion

Options:
  Preseptal orbicularis override
  Horizontal lid laxity
  Posterior Lamella foreshortening
  Capsulopalpebral fascia disinsertion
✓ Lateral lid laxity

Explanation:
Involutional entropion (inward rolling of the eyelid) is primarily caused by age-related factors such as preseptal orbicularis override (strong contraction of the orbicularis muscle), horizontal lid laxity (generalized), disinsertion of the lower lid retractors (capsulopalpebral fascia disinsertion), and sometimes posterior lamellar foreshortening. Lateral lid laxity, however, is a factor that contributes more directly to ectropion (outward rolling) by allowing the lid to sag laterally, rather than rolling inward.

================================================================================
Question 174 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50yrs poor & literate patient comes to tye and with irritation both eyes for many times. On examination there is mild conjunctival redness. His vision is 6/6 both eyes. Eyes are dirty & there are some moving objects in the eye lashes. What is the most probable cause?

Options:
  Allergic Conjunctivitis
  Anterior Blepharitis
✓ Phthiriasis bulbi
  Posterior blepharitis
  Viral keratitis

Explanation:
The presence of irritation, dirty eyes, and 'moving objects in the eyelashes' (which are often nits or adult lice) in a patient with otherwise normal vision is highly suggestive of phthiriasis palpebrarum (pubic lice infestation of the eyelashes and eyelid margins), commonly caused by *Phthirus pubis*.

================================================================================
Question 175 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Options:
✓ Basal cell carcinoma
  Squamous cell carcinonsa
  Keratoacanthoma
  Sebaceous gland carcinomia
  melanoma

Explanation:
The description of a chronic (2 years), slowly growing lesion on the lower eyelid as a shiny, firm, pearly nodule with small overlying dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia) is the classic clinical presentation of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which is the most common malignant tumor of the eyelid.

================================================================================
Question 177 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 year old male comes to eye OPD with a 3 month history of painless swelling on his right upper lid. O/E there is posterior Blepharitis and a smooth rounded nodule slightly away from lid margin. What is mast probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Basal cell cacinoma
✓ Chalazion
  Internal hordeolum
  Lipoma
  Stye

Explanation:
A painless, smooth, rounded nodule within the eyelid, associated with posterior blepharitis (which affects meibomian glands), and located slightly away from the lid margin, is characteristic of a chalazion. It represents chronic inflammation of a meibomian gland.

================================================================================
Question 178 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6 months old baby is presented by his parents with drooping of right upper eyelid with absence of eyelid crease since birth. Rest of ocular examination is unremarkable. What is most probabale diagnosis?

Options:
  Congenital entropion
✓ Simple congenital ptosis
  Horner syndrome
  Congenital 3rd nerve palsy
  Dermatochalasis

Explanation:
The key features of drooping of the upper eyelid, absent eyelid crease, and presence since birth, with an otherwise unremarkable ocular examination, point to simple congenital ptosis. This is typically due to a developmental abnormality of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle.

================================================================================
Question 179 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 years old male presented with a lesion on the right lower eye lid for the last 2 years. He is a farmer by occupation. On examination the lesion is a shiny, firm, pearly nodule with small overlying dilated blood vessels. It most frequently arises fram

================================================================================
Question 180 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years young boy came to the OPD with recurrent chalazion. Recurrent chalazion should be subjected to histopathological evaluation to exclude the possibility of?

Options:
  Basal cell carcinoma
  Kaposi sarcoma
  Malignant Melanoma
✓ Sebaceous cell carcinoma
  Squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation:
Recurrent chalazion, especially if occurring in the same location, unilateral, in an atypical pattern, or unresponsive to conventional treatment, should raise suspicion for sebaceous cell carcinoma. This aggressive eyelid malignancy can mimic a chalazion or chronic blepharitis and requires histopathological evaluation for definitive diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 181 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A male patient was complaining of continuous redness of bath eyes, foreign body sensation, and frequent loss of lashes. On examination, the lid margins were hyperemic, and the lashes were matted with yellow crusts, which left painful ulcers on trying to move. The most reliable diagnosis is

Options:
  Cicartricial entopion
  Spastic entopion
  Scaly blepharitis
  Posterior Blepharitis
✓ Ulcerative blepharitis

Explanation:
The combination of chronic redness, foreign body sensation, loss of eyelashes (madarosis), hyperemic lid margins, matted yellow crusts, and painful ulcers at the base of the eyelashes is the classic presentation of ulcerative anterior blepharitis, typically caused by staphylococcal infection.

================================================================================
Question 182 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young patient presents with painless swelling in upper lid for 3 months. The chalazion is a

Options:
  Non granulomatous inflammation
✓ Lipogrenulomatous inflammation
  Caseating granuloma
  Non caseating granuloma
  Hypersensitivity reaction

Explanation:
A chalazion is a chronic, sterile, lipogranulomatous inflammation of the meibomian gland. It develops due to the obstruction of a meibomian gland duct, leading to the leakage of lipid contents into the surrounding tissue, which then elicits a granulomatous inflammatory response.

================================================================================
Question 183 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old male came to the OPD with mass on the medial canthal area On histological evaluation it came to be squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour was resected but irradiation was also required for complete cure from the carcinoma. What is complication of irradiation to medial canthal area?

Options:
  Skin damage
  Madarosis
✓ Nasolacrimal duct stenosis
  Dry eye
  Keratopathy

Explanation:
Irradiation (radiotherapy) to the medial canthal area for eyelid malignancies can damage the delicate tissues of the nasolacrimal drainage system, leading to fibrosis and subsequent stenosis (narrowing) of the nasolacrimal duct. This results in epiphora (excessive tearing) as a common complication.

================================================================================
Question 184 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A mother brings her three months baby with capillary hemangioma of Rt upper lid. The most effective treatment for this condition is?

Options:
  Intralesional Avastin injection
  Intralesional steroid injection
  Laser ablation
✓ Oral propranolol therapy
  Surgical excision

Explanation:
For problematic infantile capillary hemangiomas (strawberry hemangiomas), especially those affecting the eyelid and potentially causing amblyopia or visual axis obstruction, oral propranolol therapy has become the first-line and most effective treatment. It typically causes rapid regression of the hemangioma.

================================================================================
Question 185 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient 25 yrs female complaining of Irritation redness foreign body sensation for many times. On examination her vision is 6/6 both eyes, anteriar blepharitis is noted. What is the common organism for this problem?

Options:
  Aspergillus
  Gonococcus
  Hemophilus
✓ Staphylococcus
  Streptococcus

Explanation:
Anterior blepharitis, particularly the ulcerative form, is a common inflammatory condition of the eyelid margin. *Staphylococcus aureus* is the most common bacterial organism responsible for this problem, causing irritation, redness, and foreign body sensation.

================================================================================
Question 186 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 year old female has been complaining of epiphors of the right eye for six months. On examination the regurgitation test is positive. There is obstruction of nasolacrimal duct on sac wash and syringing. When performing DCR, The asheum is created at the level of the :

Options:
  Superior turbinate
✓ Middle turbinate
  Inferior turbinate
  Posterior lacrimal crest
  Anterior lacrimal crest

Explanation:
During a dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) procedure, an ostium (opening) is created in the nasal bone, connecting the lacrimal sac to the nasal cavity. This opening is typically made at the level of the middle turbinate to ensure effective tear drainage and patency.

================================================================================
Question 187 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient 50 yrs female with history of Anorexia Nervosa is aroughs by the attendant tor some ocular problem. On examination her vision is 6/6 both eyes. There are some conjunctival dry & lusterless points which show Vitamin A deficiency. Which layer of the tear film is affected by this condition.?

Options:
  Aqueous layer
  lipid layer
  Lactoferrin
  Mixed layer
✓ Mucin layer

Explanation:
Vitamin A deficiency primarily affects the goblet cells of the conjunctiva, which are responsible for producing mucin. Mucin forms the innermost layer of the tear film and is crucial for wetting the corneal and conjunctival surfaces. A deficiency leads to xerosis (dryness) and lusterless conjunctival points (Bitot spots).

================================================================================
Question 188 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4 months baby brought by the mother complaining of watering since birth. You diagnosed the baby as having congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. What is the first line of treatment.???

Options:
  DCR
  DCR with intubation
  Intubation without DCR
✓ Lacrimal massage with antibiotics
  Probing

Explanation:
For congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in a 4-month-old infant, the first-line treatment is conservative management. This includes daily lacrimal sac massage (Crigler massage) and topical broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary dacryocystitis, as most cases resolve spontaneously within the first year of life.

================================================================================
Question 189 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient 25 yrs female complaining of irritation, redness, foreign body sensation for many times. On examination her vision is 6/6 both eyes, posterior blepharitis is noted. Which layer of the tear film is mostly affected in this condition?

Options:
✓ Anterior layer
  Inner layer
  Middle layer
  All layers
  No layer is affected

Explanation:
Posterior blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margin involving the meibomian glands. These glands produce the oily (lipid) layer of the tear film, which forms the outermost (anterior) layer of the tear film. Dysfunction of these glands leads to tear film instability and evaporative dry eye symptoms.

================================================================================
Question 190 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 year old patient presented with Apahars of light eye from the last & menthi On the semination there was a non-tender tyttic swelling in the right medial canthal region with regurgitation test positive. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute dacryocystitis
✓ Chronic dacryocystitis
  Dermoid Cyst
  Dacryoadenitis
  Blepharitis

Explanation:
The clinical picture of chronic epiphora (watering eye), a non-tender cystic swelling in the right medial canthal region, and a positive regurgitation test (mucopurulent discharge from the puncta on pressing the lacrimal sac) is diagnostic of chronic dacryocystitis. This is a chronic inflammation of the lacrimal sac, usually due to nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

================================================================================
Question 191 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An Ophthalmologist was giving lecture on tear film to 3rd year MBBS students. Regarding the tear film which statement is true?

Options:
✓ Has there layers
  The middle layer is from the meibomian glands
  Is predominantly mucous
  Suffers evaporative lost of 50%
  Becomes hypotonic with evaporation

Explanation:
The tear film is composed of three distinct layers: an outer lipid layer (produced by meibomian glands), a middle aqueous layer (produced by the lacrimal glands), and an inner mucin layer (produced by conjunctival goblet cells).

================================================================================
Question 192 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years female presents with watering eye since three years. To diagnose chronic dacryocystitis, one has tu understand that lacrimal sac swelling presents?

Options:
✓ Below the medial palpebral ligament
  Above the medial palpebral ligament
  Lateral to medial palpebral ligament
  Medial in medial palpebral ligament
  Behind the medial palpebral ligament

Explanation:
The lacrimal sac is anatomically located in the lacrimal fossa, which is situated below the medial palpebral ligament. Therefore, swelling associated with chronic dacryocystitis or a mucocele typically presents as a mass located below the medial palpebral ligament in the medial canthal area.

================================================================================
Question 193 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A mother brought iter six months child to OPD with epiphora right eye since birth. The examing doctor suspects right congenital naso-lacrimal duct obstruction. The most appropriate treatmem for Dils child at this age?

Options:
  Balloon catheter dilation
  Bicanalicular silicone intubation
✓ Probing of nasolacrimal duct
  External Dacryocystorhinostomy
  Laser dacryocystorhinastomy

Explanation:
For congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (epiphora since birth) in a 6-month-old child, after an initial trial of conservative lacrimal sac massage and topical antibiotics, if symptoms persist, probing of the nasolacrimal duct is often considered as the next appropriate step before 12 months of age.

================================================================================
Question 194 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A father brings a shree marithe bay for complaints of watering both eyes since birth. Examination under anaesthesia was planned. What is the most important test?

Options:
  Lacrimal regurgitation
✓ intraocular pressure
  Corneal diameter measurement
  Fundus examination
  Anterior segment examination

Explanation:
For an infant with watering eyes since birth undergoing examination under anesthesia, measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) is a crucial test. Congenital glaucoma can present with epiphora, photophobia, and often buphthalmos (enlarged globe), and elevated IOP is a key diagnostic feature that needs to be ruled out due to its sight-threatening nature.

================================================================================
Question 195 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old male complains of gradually increasing proptosis of the left eye. There is no associated pain and inflammation. CT Scan shows globular enlargement of the lacrimal gland with no extension anterior to the orbital rim. Few areas of calcification are observed. What is the likeliest diagnosis?

Options:
  Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland
✓ Pleomorphic adenoma of the lacrimal gland
  Meningioma
  Dermoid cyst
  Neurofibromatosis type 2

Explanation:
A gradually increasing, painless proptosis with globular enlargement of the lacrimal gland and the presence of calcification on CT scan, without signs of acute inflammation, is highly suggestive of a pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumor) of the lacrimal gland. This is the most common benign epithelial tumor of the lacrimal gland.

================================================================================
Question 196 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10yrs bay is brought by his father comes to eye opd with redness irritation photophobia for the last to many times. These signs and symptoms typically increase in summer & decrease in winter. His vision is 6/6 in both eyes. There is watery discharge with it. What is the most probable cause

Options:
  Allergic Conjunctivitis
  Blepharitis
✓ Vernal Conjunctivitis
  Viral Conjunctivitis
  Scleritis

Explanation:
The recurrent nature of eye symptoms (redness, irritation, photophobia), their exacerbation in summer and amelioration in winter, along with watery discharge, are classic characteristics of Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), a seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

================================================================================
Question 197 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient 25 yrs female complaining of mucopurulent discharge for 2-3 months. She has been treated here and there, but no relief. On examination her vision is 6/6 both eyes. On upper lid eversion there are many follicles in the conjunctiva What can be the most probable diagnosis.?

Options:
  allergic Conjunctivitis
  Anterior Blepharitis
✓ Trachoma
  Vernal catarrh
  Viral keratitis

Explanation:
The chronic mucopurulent discharge, unresponsiveness to previous treatments, and the presence of numerous follicles on the upper tarsal conjunctiva are classic diagnostic features of trachoma, a chronic follicular conjunctivitis caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis*.

================================================================================
Question 198 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12years old child presented to OPD with Itching and lantation. On examination on and watering of eyes. There were conjunctival congestion with cobble stone appearance of palpebral conjunctiva. His parents are giving history of the same condition every year from the last 5 years in summer season. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute allergic reaction
  Adenoviral conjuntivitis
✓ Vernal keratoconjunctivitis
  Recurrent membraneous conjunctivitis
  Trachoma

Explanation:
The symptoms of severe itching, watering eyes, conjunctival congestion, and the distinctive 'cobblestone appearance' of the upper tarsal conjunctiva (due to giant papillae), recurring annually in the summer season in a child, are pathognomonic for Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC).

================================================================================
Question 199 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient 50 yrs female with history of Anorexia Nervosa is brought by the attendant for some ecular problem, On examination her vision is 6/6 both eyes. There are some conjunctival dry & lusterless points with dry eyes which shows Vitamin A deficiency. Which layer of the tear film is affected by this condition.?

Options:
  Aqueous layer
  Lipid layer
  Lactoferrin
  Mixed layer
✓ Mucin layer

Explanation:
Vitamin A deficiency leads to the loss of goblet cells in the conjunctiva, which are responsible for secreting mucin. The mucin layer is crucial for wetting the corneal surface. Its deficiency results in a dry, lusterless conjunctiva (xerosis) and spots like Bitot's spots.

================================================================================
Question 200 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient 50 yrs female complaining of vritation redness foreign body sensation. On examination her vision is 6/6 both eyes you suspect dry eye and you want to do Schirmer test for 5 minutes for confirmation. What is the parameter for confirmation?

Options:
  Less than 5 mm
✓ Less than 10 mm
  Less than 15mm
  Less than 20mm
  Less than 25mm

Explanation:
The Schirmer test measures tear production. A reading of less than 10 mm of wetting of the filter paper strip after 5 minutes is generally considered indicative of tear deficiency (dry eye). Some criteria use less than 5 mm for severe dry eye, but less than 10 mm is a common diagnostic cutoff.

Question 201 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50yrs patient comes to eye opd with redness irritation photophobia and severe pain Left eye for the last 45 times. He gives history of agriculture trauma while working in farms. His vision is 6/5 eye and in his Left eye. There is severe redness, corneal defect & hypopyon in his left eye. There is a purulent discharge with it. What is the most probable cause:

Options:
  Conjunctivitis
  Blepharitis
✓ Bacterial keratitis
  Viral keratitis
  Sub conjunctival hg

Explanation:
Although agricultural trauma often points to fungal etiology, the presence of 'purulent discharge' and a severe acute presentation is often more characteristic of bacterial keratitis. Fungal keratitis typically has a drier, necrotic appearance with feathery margins. However, fungal is also a strong differential. Given 'purulent discharge' specifically mentioned, bacterial keratitis is a very strong candidate, often secondary to vegetative trauma as well. Often questions distinguish fungal by 'fluffy/feathery' and bacterial by 'purulent/suppurative'.

================================================================================
Question 202 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50yrs patient comes to eye and with Irritation & pain in right eye for 10-15 days. On examination there is mild conjunctival redness. His vision is 6/12 right eye & 6/6 Lt eye. On examination there is a branching epithelial corneal defect. How you will treat this patient?

Options:
  Observation
  Oral analgesic
  Topical antibiotic
  Topical antifungal
✓ Topical antiviral

Explanation:
A branching epithelial corneal defect is a dendritic ulcer, diagnostic of Herpes Simplex Keratitis. The treatment of choice is a topical antiviral agent, such as acyclovir or ganciclovir ointment/gel.

================================================================================
Question 203 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 years old patient presented with decreased vision in the right eye associated with foreign body sensation and decreased visies and watering You examined the patient and found a carneal sicer. Which of the following drugs are contraindicated in a corneal ulcer patient?

Options:
  Antibiotics
  Cycloplegics
✓ Steroids
  Analgesics
  Antifungals

Explanation:
Topical steroids are generally contraindicated in the active stage of an infectious corneal ulcer (especially bacterial, fungal, or herpetic epithelial) because they inhibit the immune response, collagen synthesis, and wound healing, potentially leading to perforation or worsening of the infection.

================================================================================
Question 204 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years adult was admitted in the ward with redness in Rt eye for last 2 weeks. There was dense corneal stromal filtration with epithelial defect. What is the most important step in the management of this microbial keratitis?

Options:
  Stop contact lenses if any
✓ Intensive topical antibiotics
  Oral antibiotics if limba lesion
  Topical cycloplegics
  Oral analgesics

Explanation:
For microbial keratitis (corneal ulcer), the most critical step to save the eye is the rapid initiation of intensive topical broad-spectrum antibiotics (often fortified) to control the infection. While stopping contact lenses is important, the *treatment* itself relies on the antibiotics.

================================================================================
Question 205 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years male Phakic patient came for the follow up checkup after pars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil surgery. What is the most common refractive change that occurs with silicon oil?

Options:
  Less hypermetropic
  Less myopic
✓ More hypermetropic
  More myopic
  No refractive changes

Explanation:
In a phakic eye, silicone oil (which has a higher refractive index than vitreous but lower than the lens) alters the refraction. The interface between the posterior lens surface and the silicone oil acts as a negative lens, causing a hyperopic shift (more hypermetropic).

================================================================================
Question 206 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old female with a history of well- controlled diabetes recently underwent uncomplicated phaco- emulsification with a posterior chamber intraocular lens in her left eye and now she complains of blurry vision. Her Best- corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 20/80 in her left tys. Her FFA shows a flower petal pattern of hyper fluorescence. Which retinal layer accounts for the appearance of this patient's vision loss?

Options:
  Inner plexiform
  Outer nuclear
✓ Outer plexiform
  Nerve fiber layer
  Retinal pigment epithelium

Explanation:
The flower petal pattern on FFA is diagnostic of Cystoid Macular Edema (CME). In CME, fluid accumulates primarily in the Outer Plexiform Layer (Henle's layer) of the retina, creating cyst-like spaces arranged radially around the fovea.

================================================================================
Question 207 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years aphakic male patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy. While putting silicone oil there is a great chance of pupillary black glaucoma. What is the best procedure during surgery to prevent pupillary black glaucoma in this patient?

Options:
✓ Performing iridectomy
  Performing laser
  No extra precaution needed
  Can be managed medically later
  Trabeculectomy

Explanation:
In aphakic eyes filled with silicone oil, the oil bubble can block the pupil, preventing aqueous flow (pupillary block) and causing acute glaucoma. To prevent this, a surgical inferior peripheral iridectomy (Ando iridectomy) is performed at the 6 o'clock position to allow aqueous to pass into the anterior chamber even if the pupil is blocked by the buoyant oil.

================================================================================
Question 208 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:

Which of the following visual field defects are not associated with glaucoma?

Options:
  Nasal step
  Paracenral defect
  Arcuate lesions
✓ Homonymous hemianopia
  Ring scotoma

Explanation:
Homonymous hemianopia is a neurological field defect caused by lesions in the retro-chiasmal visual pathway (e.g., stroke, tumor). It respects the vertical midline. Glaucomatous defects (nasal step, arcuate/Bjerrum scotoma, paracentral scotoma, ring scotoma) are nerve fiber bundle defects that typically respect the horizontal midline.

================================================================================
Question 214 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Amjad, a 60-year-old man, visits an eye clinic for a routine checkup. He has no significant medical history. During the examination, the ophthalmologist measures his intraocular pressure (IOP), which is found to be 28 mm Hg in both eyes and open angles on gonioscopy. The rest of the eye exam and investigations are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Open-angle glaucoma
✓ Ocular Hypertension
  Angle-closure glaucoma
  Secondary glaucoma
  Lens induced glaucoma

Explanation:
Ocular Hypertension is defined as elevated IOP (>21 mmHg) with normal optic nerves and visual fields, and open angles, in the absence of any other ocular or systemic cause. Since the rest of the exam is normal, this fits the definition.

================================================================================
Question 215 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old man with a family history of glaucoma, regularly visits his eye doctor for checkups.

Explanation:
Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG) is a form of open-angle glaucoma characterized by glaucomatous optic nerve damage and visual field loss despite IOP consistently remaining within the normal range (<21 mmHg).

================================================================================
Question 216 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old woman, has been diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma and has been prescribed toplest fatanoprost to lower her IOP. Despite taking her medication regularly, her IOP remains high. What might be the next step in her treatment?

Options:
  lncrease the dosage of her current medication
✓ Add a different class of glaucoma medication
  Schedule her for immediate surgery
  Discontinue glaucoma medications and monitor closely
  continue same medications

Explanation:
If monotherapy (like latanoprost) is insufficient to reach the target IOP, the standard next step is to either switch to another class or, more commonly, add a second drug from a different class (e.g., beta-blocker, alpha-agonist, or CAI) to achieve better control.

================================================================================
Question 217 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old man has been experiencing gradual peripheral vision loss in both eyes.

================================================================================
Question 254 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Principle of scleral buckling surgery in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment:

Options:
  Flatten retina by removing vitreous traction
  Create chorioretinal scar around the break
✓ Indent the sclera to support the retinal break
  Replace vitreous with silicone oil
  Drain subretinal fluid completely

Explanation:
The primary goal of scleral buckling is to indent the sclera (buckle it inward) to relieve vitreous traction and support the retinal break, allowing the RPE to pump out subretinal fluid and reattach the retina.

================================================================================
Question 255 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A diabetic man presents with progressive painful ophthalmoplegia, lid edema, and black eschar on palate. Diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Likely Mucormycosis (Rhinocerebral)

Explanation:
The combination of diabetes, orbital symptoms (ophthalmoplegia), and a 'black eschar' (necrotic tissue) on the palate or nasal turbinates is pathognomonic for Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis, a fungal emergency.

================================================================================
Question 256 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old man presents with slowly progressive painless proptosis and restricted elevation. CT orbit shows an expansile lesion in frontal sinus eroding into orbit. Most likely diagnosis:

Options:
  Dermoid cyst
✓ Frontoethmoidal mucocele
  Lymphangioma
  Pleomorphic adenoma
  Cavernous hemangioma

Explanation:
Mucoceles are cystic lesions that arise from obstruction of sinus ostia. They are slowly expansile and can erode through bone (frontal sinus into the orbit), causing proptosis and mass effect.

================================================================================
Question 257 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old male presents with sudden painless loss of vision. Fundus shows vitreous hemorrhage. Cause?

Options:
  Retinal detachment
  Central retinal artery occlusion
  Central retinal vein occlusion

Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) involves the growth of fragile new blood vessels (neovascularization) which commonly rupture, causing spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage and sudden vision loss.

================================================================================
Question 258 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which muscle function is lost in abducent nerve palsy?

Options:
✓ Lateral rectus
  Medial rectus

Explanation:
The Abducent nerve (CN VI) innervates the Lateral Rectus muscle. Palsy results in loss of abduction (inability to look outward).

================================================================================
Question 259 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
In myotonic dystrophy, what type of ptosis is seen?

Options:
  Mechanical
  Congenital
  Aponeurotic
✓ Myogenic

Explanation:
Myotonic dystrophy is a muscular dystrophy; the ptosis is caused by primary weakness of the levator muscle fibers, making it a myogenic ptosis.

================================================================================
Question 260 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old man presents to ER with ptosis, dilated pupil, eye down and out. Which cranial nerve is affected?

Options:

  Trochlear
✓ Oculomotor
  Optic
  OFL

Explanation:
These are classic signs of a complete Oculomotor (CN III) nerve palsy: Ptosis (levator), mydriasis (sphincter pupillae), and 'down and out' position (unopposed action of SO and LR).

================================================================================
Question 261 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old female with long-standing hypertension shows only arteriovenous nicking and general narrowing of arterioles. No hemorrhages or exudates. Which grade of retinopathy?

Options:
✓ Grade 1
  Grade 2
  Grade 3
  Grade 4
  Hypertensive choroidopathy

Explanation:
Generalized narrowing is Grade 1. AV nicking is typically the hallmark of Grade 2. However, in the absence of hemorrhages/exudates (Grade 3) or papilledema (Grade 4), this represents early hypertensive changes. The provided key selects Grade 1.

================================================================================
Question 262 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which finding suggests afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil)?

Options:
✓ Pupil dilates when light is moved from normal eye

Explanation:
In an APD, the affected eye perceives less light. When the flashlight is swung from the healthy eye to the affected eye, the consensual constriction signal is lost, and the pupil paradoxically dilates.

================================================================================
Question 263 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Tractional retinal detachment occurs commonly in association with:

Options:
  High myopia
  Trauma
✓ Diabetic retinopathy
  Retinoschisis
  Posterior uveitis

Explanation:
Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy leads to the formation of fibrovascular membranes. As these membranes contract, they pull on the retina, causing Tractional Retinal Detachment.

================================================================================
Question 264 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Best investigation for CSR:

Options:
✓ OCT

Explanation:

================================================================================
Question 266 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Which feature differentiates benign intracranial hypertension from a space-occupying lesion?

Options:
  Headache
  Papilledema
✓ Normal neuroimaging
  Visual field defect
  Vomiting

Explanation:
Both BIH (Pseudotumor Cerebri) and Space-Occupying Lesions (tumors) cause raised ICP (headache, papilledema). The distinguishing feature is that BIH has normal neuroimaging (no mass seen).

================================================================================
Question 267 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Lesions at optic chiasma cause:

Options:
✓ Bitemporal hemianopia

================================================================================

Question:
Down and in movement of eye is done by:

Options:
  Superior rectus
  Medial rectus
✓ Superior oblique
  Inferior oblique
  Inferior rectus

Explanation:
The primary action of the Superior Oblique is intorsion, but its depressive action is maximal when the eye is adducted (looking in). Therefore, it moves the adducted eye down.

================================================================================
Question 270 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Indications for pars plana vitrectomy:

Options:
  Epiretinal membrane
  Diabetic retinopathy
✓ Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment

Explanation:
PPV is used for all these conditions, but in the context of the key, it is the primary surgical choice for complicated Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachments (e.g., with PVR, giant tears) or when buckling isn't suitable.

================================================================================
Question 271 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
The principle of scleral buckling surgery in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is to:

Options:
  Flatten the retina by removal of vitreous
  Create chorioretinal scar around break
✓ Indent the sclera to support retinal break externally
  Replace vitreous with silicone dye
  Drain subretinal fluid completely

Explanation:
Scleral buckling works by externally indenting the eye wall to close the retinal break, reducing the distance between the RPE and the detached retina.

================================================================================
Question 272 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Patient presented with swelling, dryness, loss of lash follicle, mass at lid margin, painless and immobile. Diagnosis:

Options:
✓ Chalazion
  Hordeolum
  Dermoid cyst
  Epidermoid cyst
  Sebaceous cyst

Explanation:
A Chalazion is a chronic, painless lipogranuloma of the meibomian gland. While 'loss of lash follicle' can imply malignancy, in the context of common exams, a firm, painless, immobile lid mass is typically identified as a Chalazion.

================================================================================
Question 273 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old male presented with sudden painless loss of vision. Fundus shows vitreous hemorrhage. Cause:

Options:
  Retinal detachment
  Central retinal artery occlusion
  Central retinal vein occlusion
✓ Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
  Central serous retinopathy

Explanation:
Spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage in a 60-year-old is most commonly caused by Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy due to the rupture of fragile neovascular vessels.

================================================================================
Question 274 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5-year-old with constant right eye deviation and poor vision; deviation is constant and visual acuity is 6/60 despite refractive correction. Cause of poor vision:

Options:
  Optic neuritis
  Retinal detachment
  Retinoblastoma
✓ Amblyopia

Explanation:
This is Strabismic Amblyopia. The constant deviation causes the brain to suppress the image from the deviating eye to avoid diplopia, leading to poor visual development in that eye.

================================================================================
Question 275 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5-year-old boy with white pupillary reflex and calcified fundus mass. Diagnosis:

Options:

The combination of leukocoria and calcification in a 5-year-old is highly specific for Retinoblastoma.

================================================================================
Question 276 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 34-year-old man presents with gradual painless vision loss, mass superotemporally in orbit compressing orbit inferonasally. CT shows smooth lobulated bony lesion. Diagnosis:

Options:
  Dermoid cyst
  Epidermoid cyst
✓ Lacrimal gland pleomorphic adenoma

Explanation:
The Lacrimal Gland is located in the superotemporal orbit. A 'smooth lobulated bony lesion' (fossa formation) with a gradual painless course is characteristic of a benign Pleomorphic Adenoma.

================================================================================
Question 277 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old male presents with double vision for 2 days. On examination, his right eye shows ptosis and is deviated downwards and outwards. Pupillary reaction is normal. Most likely diagnosis:

Options:
  Complete 3rd nerve palsy
✓ Partial 3rd nerve palsy
  4th nerve palsy
  6th nerve palsy
  Myasthenia gravis

Explanation:
The findings are consistent with CN III palsy (ptosis, down and out deviation). The normal pupillary reaction (pupil sparing) distinguishes it as a partial palsy, often microvascular in origin (though less common in a 25yo, it rules out compression which affects the pupil).

================================================================================
Question 278 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 58-year-old hypertensive patient presented with blurring of vision. Fundus shows wedge-shaped area of superficial retinal hemorrhages limited to the superotemporal quadrant with macular edema. Diagnosis:

Options:
  CRVO
  CRAO
✓ BRVO
  Hypertensive retinopathy
  Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

Explanation:
The hemorrhages are sectoral (wedge-shaped) and limited to one quadrant, indicating the occlusion is in a branch vein (Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), typically at an AV crossing.

================================================================================
Question 279 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
In pneumatic retinopexy, the retinal break should be located:

Options:
  Inferior
  Posterior to equator
✓ Superior within 1 hour of 12 o’clock
  At the ora serrata
  Near the macula

Explanation:
Pneumatic retinopexy uses an intravitreal gas bubble to tamponade the break. Since gas rises against gravity, the break must be located in the superior retina (ideally between 11 and 1 o'clock) for the bubble to cover it effectively.

================================================================================
Question 280 (KGMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question 384 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old man presents to Eye OPD with diplopia and bilateral droopy eyelids which worsen in the evening. There is also a history of fatigability. On examination, his visual acuity is 6/6 in both eyes. Anterior and posterior segment examination is unremarkable. There is bilateral ptosis partially obstructing the visual axis and 20 prism diopter esotropia. Which of the following tests would you perform next?

Options:
  Chest X-ray
  CT head
✓ Ice pack test
  MRI brain
  Serum antibodies

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigable weakness, specifically ptosis and diplopia that worsen as the day progresses, are classic for ocular Myasthenia Gravis. The ice pack test is a simple, quick, and specific bedside test for this condition. Applying ice to the droopy eyelid for 2-5 minutes can temporarily improve the ptosis in myasthenic patients, as cold improves neuromuscular transmission.

================================================================================
Question 385 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 80-year-old Caucasian smoker woman complains of recent problems with reading vision, specifically words appearing distorted and blank patches being present. Her vision is often good in brighter light. On examination, her vision is 6/36 both eyes with no further improvement with refraction. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable. Pupils are reactive to light. Fundus shows numerous intermediate-size soft drusen in both eyes with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). How will you manage?

Options:
  Intravitreal antibiotics
✓ Intravitreal antiVEGF
  Multivitamins
  Subconjunctival decadron
  Subtenon triamcinolone

Explanation:
The diagnosis is wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), confirmed by the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The standard of care and first-line treatment for wet AMD is intravitreal injections of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (anti-VEGF) agents. These drugs inhibit the growth of abnormal blood vessels, reducing leakage and preserving vision.

================================================================================
Question 386 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old man presents to the Eye clinic with a 3 days history of left eye pain. On examination, her VA is CF in the left eye and 6/18 in the right eye. Left anterior chamber is deep and shows cells and flare. There are bilateral cataracts. The left cataract is hypermature and IOP in the same eye is 50mmHg. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Lens particle glaucoma
  Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma
  Phacoantigenic glaucoma
✓ Phacolytic glaucoma
  Phacomorphic glaucoma

Explanation:
Phacolytic glaucoma occurs when a hypermature cataract leaks soluble lens proteins through an intact lens capsule. These proteins are engulfed by macrophages, which then obstruct the trabecular meshwork, leading to acute open-angle glaucoma with very high IOP and inflammation. Phacomorphic glaucoma involves a swollen lens pushing the iris forward, causing angle closure.

================================================================================
Question 387 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10 years old boy presents with dimness of vision in the right eye for a long time. On examination, his visual acuity is 6/36 in the right eye, there is right RAPD. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable. Right fundus shows optic atrophy. Laboratory workup is not significant. You are suspecting a space-occupying lesion. What is the most appropriate next step of investigation in this patient?

Options:
  CT
  CTA
  CTV
  MRA
✓ MRI

Explanation:
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides superior soft-tissue contrast compared to CT, making it the investigation of choice for visualizing the optic nerves, chiasm, and brain. In a child with unilateral optic atrophy, an MRI is essential to rule out a compressive lesion like an optic nerve glioma or craniopharyngioma.

================================================================================
Question 388 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old male came to OPD with sudden blurring of vision in his right eye. Visual acuity (VA) in right eye is 6/9 and VA in left eye is 6/6. On fundus examination, there are superior temporal venous engorgement, flame-shaped hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. Your diagnosis is branch retinal vein occlusion. What is the most appropriate treatment in this case?

Options:
  AntiVEGF
  Argon laser
  Intravitreal dexamethasone
  Intravitreal triamcinolone
✓ Observation

Explanation:
In a case of branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) where the visual acuity is still good (6/9) and there is no significant macular edema or neovascularization, the standard initial management is observation. Treatment with anti-VEGF or laser is typically initiated only if vision-threatening complications develop.

================================================================================
Question 389 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42 years old man presented with watering and redness of right eye from the last 6 months. On examination there was restricted extraocular movements with lid lag and scleral show. The patient was found to have proptosis. What is the best way to measure the amount of his proptosis?

Options:
  B-Scan ultrasonography
  Computed Tomography (CT)
  Corneal topography
✓ Exophthalmo-metery
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

Explanation:
Exophthalmometry is the specific clinical method used to measure the degree of proptosis (forward protrusion of the eyeball). An instrument like the Hertel exophthalmometer is used to quantify the distance from the lateral orbital rim to the corneal apex, allowing for objective measurement and monitoring.

================================================================================
Question 390 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 3-old child is brought to Pediatric Ophthalmic OPD with leucokoria. Two of her siblings also have same problem. On examination, there are bilateral cataracts. There is no fundus view due to this media opacity. B-scan is normal. How will you manage?

Options:
  Glasses prescription
  Laser refractive surgery
✓ Lensectomy with intraocular lens implantation
  Observation
  Pars plana vitrectomy

Explanation:
Visually significant congenital or infantile cataracts are an ophthalmic emergency as they can lead to irreversible amblyopia (lazy eye). The definitive treatment is surgical removal of the cataractous lens (lensectomy), typically combined with primary intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in a 3-year-old child to correct the vision.

================================================================================
Question 391 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old man presents to you with a mass on the left lower eyelid for 10 years. On examination, there is a well-circumscribed mass on the lower eyelid with rolled edges and central ulceration. You are suspecting basal cell carcinoma (BCC). What is most common complication that can be expected in this patient?

Options:
  Hematogenous metastasis to the brain
  Hematogenous metastasis to the liver
  Hematogenous metastasis to the lungs
✓ Local invasion of skull and CNS
  Lymphatic metastasis

Explanation:
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignancy of the eyelid. It is characterized by slow growth and local invasion. While metastasis is extremely rare, the most significant complication is its potential for direct, local invasion into the orbit, surrounding facial bones, skull, and central nervous system if left untreated.

================================================================================
Question 392 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years male presented to you with sudden painless loss of vision in his right eye. Visual acuity in right eye is CF 4m while in left eye it is 6/6. On fundus examination, there were flame shaped hemorrhages in all quadrants, dilated tortuous vessels and swollen disc. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
  Central retinal artery occlusion
✓ Central retinal vein occlusion
  Macular hole
  Retinal detachment

Explanation:
The characteristic fundus appearance described as 'blood and thunder'—involving hemorrhages in all four quadrants, venous dilation and tortuosity, and optic disc swelling—is pathognomonic for a Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO).

================================================================================
Question 393 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 19 years old boy presents to your clinic with droopy eyelids on right side. Visual acuities are 6/5 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. On examination, there is mild right ptosis. On slit lamp examination you notice that the iris is slightly lighter in colour on the right side. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Aponeurotic ptosis
  Blepharophimosis syndrome
✓ Congenital horners syndrome
  Congenital myogenic ptosis
  Neurogenic ptosis

Explanation:
The combination of unilateral ptosis and iris heterochromia (lighter colored iris on the affected side) are key features of Congenital Horner's Syndrome. This condition results from a disruption of the sympathetic nerve supply to the eye during development.

================================================================================
Question 394 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old male presented to you with red eyes and watering. Initially it involved right eye and after two days it spread to the left eye. His young daughter develops a similar problem other day. On examination, VA is 6/6. There is conjunctival redness with ropy discharge. Rest of the ocular examination is unremarkable. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Allergic conjunctivitis
  Bacterial conjunctivitis
  Cicatricial conjunctivitis
  Fungal conjunctivitis
✓ Viral conjunctivitis

Explanation:
The history is classic for viral conjunctivitis: an acute onset, spreading from one eye to the other, a watery or ropy discharge (not purulent), and a history of a close contact (daughter) also being affected, indicating high contagiousness.

================================================================================
Question 395 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old male presented with loss of vision in his left eye after trauma while left eye is normal. VA right eye is HM while 6/6 in left eye with right RAPD. On examination red reflex is absent in right eye, anterior segment is normal. There are pigmented cells in vitreous. Retina is elevated with tear in the superatemporal retina. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Exudative retinal detachment
  Macular hole
  Optic atrophy
✓ Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
  Tractional retinal detachment

Explanation:
A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is defined as a detachment caused by a full-thickness break (a hole or tear) in the retina, which allows vitreous fluid to seep underneath and separate the retina from the underlying tissue. The history of trauma and the finding of a retinal tear confirm this diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 396 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old hypertensive patient is complaining of decrease vision in both eyes. You performed visual field examination on the patient and found right homonymous hemianopia which is confirmed on perimetry as well. Which of the following is the most probable site of lesion?

Options:
  Left optic nerve
✓ Left optic tract
  Optic chiasma
  Right optic tract
  Right optic nerve

Explanation:
A right homonymous hemianopia is the loss of the right visual field in both eyes. This type of visual field defect is caused by a lesion in the visual pathway behind the optic chiasm on the contralateral (opposite) side. Therefore, the lesion must be in the left optic tract, left optic radiations, or left visual cortex. The most anterior of these is the left optic tract.

================================================================================
Question 397 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 years diabetic patient presented with diplopia from the last 5 days. On examination, you find that the patient is having left hypertropia with a head tilt to the right side. On extraocular motility, the hypertropia increases in right gaze. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Right inferior oblique palsy
  Right superior oblique palsy
  Left inferior rectus palsy
  Left inferior oblique palsy
✓ Left superior oblique palsy

Explanation:
This clinical scenario fits the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test for a superior oblique palsy. The left hypertropia (step 1) which worsens on contralateral gaze (right gaze, step 2) and is typically associated with a contralateral head tilt (right tilt, step 3) is characteristic of a left superior oblique (IVth nerve) palsy.

================================================================================
Question 398 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old woman presents to Eye OPD with severe pain and dimness of vision in her right eye. She has a history of right phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation 05 days ago. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/60 in the right eye with eyelid swelling, conjunctival congestion and chemosis. There is fibrinous exudate and hypopyon in the right eye. Fundus view is hazy. Which is the most likely involved pathogen?

Options:
  Proteus spp.
  Pseudomonas spp.
  S. aureus
✓ S. epidermidis
  Streptococcus spp.

Explanation:
The presentation is classic for acute post-operative endophthalmitis. The most common causative organisms are bacteria from the patient's own ocular surface flora. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, specifically *Staphylococcus epidermidis*, are the most frequently isolated pathogens in this setting.

================================================================================
Question 399 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old girl presents to the eye clinic with a 2 days history of blurring in the right eye with pain on ocular movements. Examination reveals a visual acuity of 6/36 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. There is RAPD. Fundus examination shows right swollen optic disc. Left fundus is normal. Systemic history and examination are not significant. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute angle closure glaucoma
  Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
  Cavernous sinus thrombosis
  Giant cell arteritis
✓ Optic neuritis

Explanation:
The classic triad of acute unilateral vision loss, pain with eye movements, and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in a young person is pathognomonic for optic neuritis. The swollen optic disc indicates papillitis, a common finding in this condition.

================================================================================
Question 400 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 80 years old female presented to Eye OPD with sudden onset painful right eye with decreased vision and associated nausea. On examination she has right corneal edema with mid dilated pupil and IOP of 60 mmHg. Left eye is normal except having shallow anterior chamber. What is the immediate next step of management?

Options:
✓ Intravenous Mannitol
  Laser iridotomy in right eye
  Oral steroids
  Topical antibiotics in right eye
  Trabeculectomy in right eye

Explanation:
This is a classic presentation of acute angle-closure glaucoma, an ophthalmic emergency. The immediate goal is to lower the extremely high intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent irreversible optic nerve damage. Intravenous mannitol is a hyperosmotic agent that rapidly reduces IOP by drawing fluid out of the vitreous humor.

================================================================================
Question 401 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 years old child went on spring vacations to his village and was playing cricket. He got cricket ball injury and developed decreased vision in left eye. On slit lamp examination, there is blood in anterior chamber. What is this condition called as?

Options:
  Endophthalmitis
✓ Hyphaema
  Hypopyon
  Keratitis
  Uveitis

Explanation:
Hyphaema is the medical term for blood collecting in the anterior chamber of the eye, the space between the cornea and the iris. It is a common result of blunt trauma, such as being hit by a ball.

================================================================================
Question 402 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 58-year-old male presented with pain, dimness of vision and watering in left eye. On examination, he has visual acuity of 6/6 in right eye and 6/60 in his left eye. He has a 2.3x2.8mm corneal ulcer. Which of the following measures should be avoided in this patient?

Options:
  Antibiotics
  Antifungals
✓ Bandage contact lens
  Cycloplegics
  Irrigation with saline

Explanation:
In the case of a suspected infectious corneal ulcer, placing a bandage contact lens (BCL) is contraindicated. A BCL can trap microorganisms against the cornea, creating a warm, moist environment that can accelerate microbial replication and worsen the infection.

================================================================================
Question 403 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 56 years old diabetic patient presented with decrease vision in both eyes from the last one year. On examination, the anterior segment was normal. Fundoscopy showed retinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants with diabetic macular edema. How you will measure the amount of macular edema in this patient?

Options:
  B-Scan ultrasonography
  Fundus autofluorescence (FAF)
  Fundus Fluorescein angiography (FFA)
✓ Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
  Pachymetry

Explanation:
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the gold standard for diagnosing and quantifying diabetic macular edema. It provides high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina, allowing for precise measurement of retinal thickness and visualization of intraretinal fluid.

================================================================================
Question 404 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 52-year-old hypertensive patient presented with sudden onset diplopia and face turn to the left. On examination there is left abduction deficit. The rest of extraocular movements are normal. Which of the following nerve is involved in this condition?

Options:
  2nd nerve
  3rd nerve
  4th nerve
  5th nerve
✓ 6th nerve

Explanation:
The 6th cranial nerve (Abducens nerve) innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which is solely responsible for abduction (outward movement) of the eye. A deficit in abduction is a classic sign of a 6th nerve palsy. The face turn is a compensatory mechanism to avoid diplopia.

================================================================================
Question 405 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2 weeks old infant is brought to eye OPD with white pupillary reflex in both eyes since birth. He is systemically normal. On examination, child cannot fix and follow. There are bilateral cataracts and microcorneas. There is no view of posterior segment. B-scans are normal. What will be your next step of management?

Options:
  Corneal topography
  CT brain
  Mantoux test
  OCT macula
✓ TORCH serology

Explanation:
In an infant with bilateral congenital cataracts, it is crucial to investigate for an underlying systemic cause before proceeding with surgery. Congenital infections are a significant cause, and a TORCH serology panel (Toxoplasmosis, Other, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes) is a standard and essential part of the workup.

Question 406 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 09-year-old boy has 30 prism diopter of left esotropia. On full-time wear of +5 diopter glasses, the deviation decreased to 15 prism diopter. What is the next treatment option at this stage?

Options:
  Contact Lenses
  Low vision devices
  Multivitamin Syrup
✓ Surgery for remaining squint
  Telescopes

Explanation:
This patient has a partially accommodative esotropia. The glasses correct the accommodative component of the squint, but a residual non-accommodative deviation of 15 prism diopters remains. This residual squint requires surgical correction (strabismus surgery) to align the eyes.

================================================================================
Question 407 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 18 years old girl had severe headaches since six months, along with defective vision on temporal sides of her visual fields. What is the most probably diagnosis?

Options:
  Occipital infarct
  Optic nerves glioma
  Optic neuritis
  Optic tract glioma
✓ Pituitary adenoma

Explanation:
The loss of vision on the temporal (outer) sides of both visual fields is known as a bitemporal hemianopia. This specific visual field defect is the classic sign of a lesion compressing the optic chiasm. The pituitary gland is located directly beneath the chiasm, making a pituitary adenoma the most common cause.

================================================================================
Question 408 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-year-old lady complains of left eye redness of 2 days duration associated with photophobia and watery discharge. On exam, visual acuity is 6/12 both eyes. Cornea reveals dendritic lesion that stain well with fluorescein, Corneal sensations are reduced in left eye. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

Options:
  Artificial tears
✓ Topical antivirals
  Topical cyclosporine
  Topical NSAIDS
  Topical steroids

Explanation:
A dendritic ulcer on the cornea that stains with fluorescein, combined with reduced corneal sensation, is pathognomonic for Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) keratitis. The mainstay of treatment is a topical antiviral agent (e.g., ganciclovir gel). Topical steroids are strongly contraindicated as they can worsen the infection.

================================================================================
Question 409 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old patient presented with decreased vision in the right eye from the last 3 days associated with watering and foreign body sensation. There is also pustules and blisters involving the right side of forehead, lid up to the tip of the nose with severe pain and tingling sensation. Ocular examination shows corneal dendritic ulceration. What is the most probable diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Atopic keratoconjunctivitis
  Fungal infection
  Herpes simplex infection
✓ Herpes zoster ophthalmicus
  Steven Johnson syndrome

Explanation:
The unilateral, dermatomal vesicular rash involving the forehead and tip of the nose (Hutchinson's sign) is characteristic of shingles in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. This condition, known as Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO), frequently involves the eye, causing conditions like keratitis (dendritic ulcer).

================================================================================
Question 410 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young man recently shifted to a new home and was doing white wash of the walls. Suddenly he slipped and the white wash fell in his both eyes. What immediate treatment is needed?

Options:
✓ Copious wash of eyes with water/saline
  Pad both eyes
  Put local anesthesia eye drops in eyes
  Start antibiotic eye drops
  Start antiglaucoma medicines

Explanation:
White wash contains lime, which is a strong alkali. Alkali chemical burns are an ophthalmic emergency. The single most important and immediate step is to dilute and remove the chemical by performing copious and prolonged irrigation of the eyes with any clean water available, or sterile saline if accessible.

================================================================================
Question 411 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year old female presented to eye OPD with sudden onset redness in right eye (RE) with photophobia and decreased vision. Systemic history is positive for low back pain. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/18 in RE. There is conjunctival congestion, keratic precipitates (kps) and +4 cells in anterior chamber. Fundus examination is unremarkable. What is the primary treatment of this patient?

Options:
  Oral antibiotics
  Oral steroids
  Subtenon steroids
  Topical antibiotics
✓ Topical steroids

Explanation:
The patient has acute anterior uveitis, characterized by inflammation in the anterior chamber (cells, KPs). The primary goal of treatment is to control this inflammation to prevent complications like synechiae and glaucoma. Intensive topical corticosteroids are the first-line and mainstay of treatment.

================================================================================
Question 412 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old man presented to eye OPD with transient visual loss in left eye that lasts for few minutes. These episodes occur several times a day. Ocular examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is most appropriate initial investigation?

Options:
  Chest X-ray
  CT brain
✓ Electrocardiogram
  Renal function tests
  Thyroid function tests

Explanation:
The symptom described is amaurosis fugax, a form of transient ischemic attack (TIA) affecting the eye. It is often caused by emboli from the carotid arteries or the heart. A standard workup for TIA includes investigating the heart for sources of emboli, such as atrial fibrillation. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a crucial initial test for this purpose.

================================================================================
Question 413 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-years old farmer presented to you with pain and redness in right eye for the last 02 days. On inquiry he had trauma to his right eye with a bush of tree. On examination, visual acuity in his right eye is 6/36. He has a 2.5x3mm corneal ulcer with satellite lesions. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Acanthamoeba keratitis
  Bacterial conjunctivitis
✓ Fungal keratitis
  Marginal keratitis
  Viral keratitis

Explanation:
The combination of a history of trauma with vegetative matter (a tree bush) and the clinical finding of satellite lesions surrounding a main corneal infiltrate is highly characteristic of fungal keratitis. This presentation should be considered a fungal infection until proven otherwise.

================================================================================
Question 414 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old obese woman presented to eye OPD with severe headache especially in morning. It worsens on bending forward. She also complains of visual obscuration lasting few seconds. She is taking oral contraceptive pills for the last 1 year. She is non-diabetic and non-hypertensive. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/6. There is no RAPD. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable. Fundus examination shows, bilateral swollen discs with hemorrhages and exudates. What will be your next step of management?

Options:
  CT brain
✓ Lumber puncture
  MRI brain
  Oral acetazolamide
  Oral topiramate

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is classic for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH). The first step is neuroimaging (MRI is preferred over CT) to rule out a mass lesion. Once a mass is ruled out, a lumbar puncture (LP) is the essential next step to confirm the diagnosis by measuring an elevated opening pressure and to analyze the cerebrospinal fluid.

================================================================================
Question 415 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6 months old infant is brought by parents with complaint of watering, redness, photophobia and blepharospasm. On examination, he has nystagmus with enlarged hazy cornea. Fundus examination is not possible due to poor view. IOP is 30 in both eyes under sedation. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Conjunctivitis
✓ Congenital glaucoma
  Congenital myopia
  Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction
  Congenital rubella keratitis

Explanation:
The classic triad of symptoms (epiphora, photophobia, blepharospasm) combined with the signs of elevated intraocular pressure (enlarged, hazy cornea known as buphthalmos) in an infant is pathognomonic for primary congenital glaucoma.

================================================================================
Question 416 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4-year-old girl has convergent squint of left eye. On examination she has left amblyopia. What is the best treatment option for her?

Options:
  Glasses
  Multivitamins
  Observation
✓ Patch therapy
  Surgery

Explanation:
The primary goal before correcting the squint is to treat the amblyopia (lazy eye). The standard and most effective treatment for amblyopia is occlusion therapy, which involves patching the better-seeing eye to force the brain to use and develop the neural pathways for the amblyopic eye.

================================================================================
Question 417 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30-year-old female presented to eye OPD with sudden onset redness in right eye (RE) with photophobia and decreased vision. Systemic history is positive for low back pain. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/18 in RE. There is conjunctival congestion, keratic precipitates (kps) and +4 cells in the anterior chamber. Fundus examination is unremarkable. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Anterior uveitis
  Endophthalmitis
  Intermediate uveitis
  Panuveitis
  Posterior uveitis

Explanation:
The presence of inflammatory signs confined to the anterior segment—specifically keratic precipitates (KPs) on the endothelium and inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber—defines the condition as anterior uveitis. The association with low back pain suggests a possible systemic inflammatory condition like ankylosing spondylitis.

================================================================================
Question 418 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5 years old child is brought by her mother to you with deviation of right eye since birth. On Hirschberg test, the light reflex was falling on inner (nasal) border of right pupil. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Esotropia 15 degrees
  Esotropia 15 prism diopters
✓ Exotropia 15 degrees
  Exotropia 15 prism diopters
  Hypertropia 15 prism diopter

Explanation:
In the Hirschberg test, the corneal light reflex is assessed. If the eye is deviated outward (exotropia), the light reflex will be displaced inward (nasally) from the center of the pupil. A reflex falling on the border of the pupil corresponds to a deviation of approximately 15 degrees.

================================================================================
Question 419 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 04 months old infant is brought by parents to Eye OPD with white pupillary reflex in right eye since birth. Infant is not fixing and following light with right eye. EUA reveals rubeosis irides and a retrolental mass with vitreous seeds in right eye. Intraocular pressure is 35 in right eye and 8 in left eye. Left eye examination is unremarkable. MRI shows no invasion of optic nerve. How will you treat this infant?

Options:
  Chemotherapy
  Cryotherapy
✓ Enucleation
  Laser photocoagulation
  Radiotherapy

Explanation:
The findings are classic for advanced, unilateral retinoblastoma. Given the poor visual potential, vitreous seeding, and secondary glaucoma (high IOP with rubeosis irides), the safest and most definitive treatment is enucleation (surgical removal of the eye). This is life-saving as it prevents the tumor from spreading outside the eye.

================================================================================
Question 420 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 years old woman came to OPD with complaints of sudden decrease in vision in left eye with associated headache. The patient was also complaining of jaw claudication and pain on combing hair. On examination, her visual acuity is counting finger in left eye with RAPD and swollen optic disc. Her ESR was 60. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
  Neuroretinitis
  Non-Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
  Optic neuritis
  Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy

Explanation:
The combination of systemic symptoms (headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness) with acute, severe vision loss, a swollen optic disc, and a significantly elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) in an elderly patient is the classic presentation of Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (A-AION) caused by Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA).

================================================================================
Question 421 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old man presented to you with watering and redness in both eyes for the last 01 year. He had a previous history of cicatricial conjunctivitis. On examination, you found inward rotation of lower eyelids. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Lower lid ectropion
✓ Lower lid entropion
  Lower lid epiblepharon
  Lower lid ptosis
  Lower lid trichiasis

Explanation:
Entropion is the medical term for the inward turning of the eyelid margin. This causes the eyelashes to rub against the globe, leading to chronic irritation, redness, and watering. It can be a consequence of scarring (cicatricial) changes to the conjunctiva.

================================================================================
Question 422 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year uncontrolled diabetic woman presented with sudden decrease vision in right eye. On examination, there are bilateral cataracts. There is no RAPD. Fundus view is not clear. What investigation will you advice to assess any associated posterior segment pathology?

Options:
✓ B-Scan ultrasonography
  Fundus autoflourescence
  Fundus fluorescein angiography
  Optical coherence tomography
  Retinal photography

Explanation:
When the view of the posterior segment is obscured by a dense media opacity like a mature cataract, B-scan ultrasonography is the investigation of choice. It uses sound waves to create a two-dimensional image of the inside of the eye, allowing for the detection of pathologies like retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage.

================================================================================
Question 423 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 56 years old man presented with gradual progressive decrease vision in the right from last 8 months. On examination the vision is 6/60 in right eye and 6/9 in left eye with no improvement with pinhole. Fundus examination is hazy but seems to be normal. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Age-related macular degeneration
✓ Cataract
  Diabetic retinopathy
  Glaucoma
  Vitreous hemorrhage

Explanation:
The history of a gradual, progressive, and painless decline in vision that does not improve with a pinhole is the classic presentation of a cataract. The cataract itself is the media opacity that would cause the fundus examination to be hazy.

================================================================================
Question 424 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old man presented with decreased vision in both eyes from the last 2 years. On examination, he has a visual acuity of CF 3 meters in both eyes. On examination anterior segment is normal in both eyes and there is retinal pigment epithelial atrophy with scars in the macular region. He is non-diabetic and non-hypertensive. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Age-related macular degeneration
  Central serous chorioretinopathy
  Exudative retinal detachment
  Lattice degeneration
  Retinitis pigmentosa

Explanation:
The clinical profile of an elderly patient with bilateral, progressive central vision loss and fundus findings of atrophy and scarring confined to the macula is characteristic of atrophic (dry) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

================================================================================
Question 425 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old male presented to Eye OPD with sudden loss of vision in his right eye. He has a history of trauma to the right eye with a cricket ball 1 month ago. On examination, his visual acuity is 6/36 in right eye and 6/6 in left eye. He is having right eye RAPD. What is the likely cause of his right eye RAPD?

Options:
  Cataract
  Episcleritis
  Keratitis
✓ Retinal detachment
  Scleritis

Explanation:
A Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) indicates significant damage to the afferent visual pathway (retina or optic nerve). Following severe blunt trauma, a traumatic retinal detachment is a common cause of profound vision loss and would result in widespread retinal dysfunction, leading to a RAPD.

================================================================================
Question 426 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 years old labourer presented to your clinic with complain of watering and irritation, more frequently during sun exposure. On slit lamp examination, you observe a wedge-shaped growth of the conjunctiva that extends onto the nasal cornea. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Limbal Dermoid
  Nodular Phlyctenule
  Pinguecula
✓ Pterygium
  Scleritis

Explanation:
A pterygium is a fibrovascular growth of the conjunctiva that is typically triangular or wedge-shaped and extends onto the cornea, most commonly from the nasal side. It is strongly associated with chronic exposure to ultraviolet light, dust, and wind.

================================================================================
Question 427 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old woman presented with pain in left eye since yesterday. She is giving history of left phacoemulsification 3 days back. On examination the vision is counting fingers in left eye with conjunctival congestion and corneal edema along with hypopyon in the anterior chamber. What is the most appropriate treatment?

Options:
✓ Intravitreal antibiotics
  Peribulbar antibiotics
  Subtenon antibiotics
  Systemic antibiotics
  Topical antibiotics

Explanation:
This is a classic case of acute post-operative endophthalmitis, an ophthalmic emergency. The standard of care is immediate intervention with a vitreous tap for cultures followed by the injection of broad-spectrum antibiotics directly into the vitreous cavity (intravitreal injection) to achieve high, therapeutic drug levels at the site of infection.

================================================================================
Question 428 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old man presents to you with sudden loss of vision in his left eye. He is a known cardiac patient. On examination, VA is PL+ in left eye. Anterior segment is normal while fundus shows white cloudy retina with cherry red spot. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Branch retinal artery occlusion
  Branch retinal vein occlusion
✓ Central retinal artery occlusion
  Central retinal vein occlusion
  Hemiretinal vein occlusion

Explanation:
The funduscopic finding of a diffusely pale, ischemic retina with a contrasting 'cherry-red spot' at the macula is pathognomonic for a Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO). The cherry-red appearance is due to the intact choroidal circulation showing through the thin fovea against the backdrop of the opacified retina.

================================================================================
Question 429 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 years old female patient presented with decrease vision in the left eye along with complaint of watering from left eye. On examination, you found that the patient is having mature cataract in the left eye with positive regurgitation test of mucopurulent discharge on same side. Which procedure you will prefer to do first?

Options:
  Both cataract and DCR surgery in the same setting
  Cataract surgery alone
✓ Dacryocystorhinostomy Surgery alone
  Give antibiotics for chronic dacryocystitis and do cataract surgery
  No surgical intervention at the moment

Explanation:
Performing intraocular surgery (like cataract extraction) in the presence of an active infection in the nasolacrimal system (chronic dacryocystitis) carries a very high risk of sight-threatening postoperative endophthalmitis. It is an absolute requirement to resolve the infection first, which is done surgically with a dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). The cataract surgery can be performed at a later date.

================================================================================
Question 430 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old woman presents to you with gradual onset dimness of vision in both eyes for the last 01 year. She is known diabetic for the last 10 years. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/24 in both eyes. Anterior segment examination is within normal limits. Fundus examination shows proliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema. How will you treat this patient?

Options:
✓ AntiVEGF
  Cryotherapy
  Diffuse laser
  Focal laser
  Pars plana vitrectomy

Explanation:
This patient has two vision-threatening conditions: proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is a first-line treatment that effectively addresses both problems. It reduces macular edema and can also cause regression of the abnormal new blood vessels associated with PDR.

================================================================================
Question 431 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old male presented to you with sudden painless loss of vision in his right eye. VA in right eye is CF while it is 6/6 in left eye. On fundus examination, there were flame-shaped hemorrhages in all quadrants, dilated tortuous vessels and swollen disc. Which complication will you expect in this patient at 3 months after the event?

Options:
  Angle closure glaucoma
  Choroidal detachment
✓ Neovascular glaucoma
  Open angle glaucoma
  Retinal detachment

Explanation:
The patient has a Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). A severe, ischemic CRVO leads to retinal hypoxia, which stimulates the production of VEGF. This can lead to the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels on the iris and in the angle, causing a severe secondary glaucoma known as neovascular glaucoma. This complication typically develops around 90 days (3 months) after the initial event.

================================================================================
Question 432 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48-year-old woman came to you with difficulty in reading. She is non-diabetic and non-hypertensive. On examination, VA in both eyes is 6/6 for distance. Ocular examination is unremarkable. What is the cause of her reduced near vision?

Options:
  Amblyopia
  Astigmatism
  Hypermetropia
  Myopia
✓ Presbyopia

Explanation:
Presbyopia is the normal, age-related loss of the eye's ability to focus on near objects. It typically starts in the early to mid-40s and is caused by the hardening of the lens. The patient's age and symptom of isolated difficulty with near vision while distance vision remains clear are classic for presbyopia.

================================================================================
Question 433 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12 years old child was brought to you with complain of irritation of eyes that is most severe in summer season and recurrent. On examination, the child is having VA of 6/12 in right eye and 6/9 in left eye. On eversion of lid you find giant papillae, conjunctival congestion most marked in the limbal region with associated pseudogerontoxon. What is the most probable diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Adenoviral conjunctivitis
  Bacterial conjunctivitis
  Gonococcal conjunctivitis
  Trachoma
✓ Vernal keratoconjunctivitis

Explanation:
The combination of seasonal (summer) recurrence, intense itching, and the classic signs of giant 'cobblestone' papillae on the upper tarsal conjunctiva and limbal inflammation are pathognomonic for Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), a severe form of allergic eye disease.

================================================================================
Question 434 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16-year-old boy is brought to you with trauma by scissor when he was playing with it. On examination, you found that his cornea is perforated. What is your 1st step of management as a community doctor?

Options:
  Repairing of the cornea
  Refer the patient without doing anything
  Steroid ointment, then refer the patient
  Topical steroids then refer the patient
✓ Topical antibiotics, pad the eye then refer

Explanation:
In a case of an open globe injury (corneal perforation), the immediate priorities for a non-specialist are to prevent infection and protect the eye from further damage. This involves applying a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic, placing a protective shield (or a very gentle pad) over the eye without applying pressure, and arranging for immediate referral to an ophthalmologist for surgical repair.

================================================================================
Question 435 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65-year-old patient presented with vertical diplopia for the last week. She has a history of road traffic accident 01 week ago. On examination, vision in both eyes is 6/6. There is hypertropia of right eye and the patient cannot depress the eye in adduction. Which nerve is most probably involved?

Options:
  Abducent nerve
  Nasociliary nerve
  Oculomotor nerve
  Optic nerve
✓ Trochlear nerve

Explanation:
The superior oblique muscle is responsible for depressing the eye when it is in the adducted (turned in) position. This muscle is innervated by the trochlear nerve (IVth cranial nerve). An inability to depress the adducted eye is the classic sign of a trochlear nerve palsy, which is common after head trauma due to the nerve's long intracranial course.

================================================================================
Question 436 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 58 years old man underwent uneventful phacoemulsification surgery for cataract in his right eye. After 3 days, he presented with severe pain and loss of vision in the right eye. On examination, he was having VA of perception of light in right eye and 6/9 in the left eye. He has congested conjunctiva, hazy cornea and hypopyon with no view of posterior segment of the eye. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute angle closure glaucoma
  Loss of lens fragments into posterior segment of the eye
✓ Post-operative endophthalmitis
  Post-operative uveitis
  Post-operative vitreous hemorrhage

Explanation:
The acute onset of severe pain, profound vision loss, and intense intraocular inflammation (indicated by a hypopyon) within days of an intraocular surgery like cataract extraction is the classic presentation of post-operative endophthalmitis, a severe infection inside the eye.

================================================================================
Question 437 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 47 years old man presented with ocular pain in the right eye from the last 1 week. There is redness of the right eye with associated pain. On phenylephrine eye drops installation the redness is not reduced. The patient is also giving a history of rheumatoid arthritis. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Blepharitis
  Conjunctivitis
  Corneal ulcer
  Episcleritis
✓ Scleritis

Explanation:
Scleritis is characterized by deep, boring ocular pain and redness. A key diagnostic sign is that the redness, which originates from the deep episcleral vascular plexus, does not blanch with the application of a topical vasoconstrictor like phenylephrine. There is also a strong association between scleritis and systemic autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

================================================================================
Question 438 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#1. Eyelid margin anatomy distortion and loss of eyelashes should alert one to the possibility of what following?

Options:
  Facial nerve (VII) palsy
  Chronic eyelid webbing
  Involuntional ectropion
✓ Malignancy
  Senile changes

Explanation:
Distortion of the eyelid margin anatomy (e.g., notching) and madarosis (loss of eyelashes) are classic warning signs of a malignant tumor, such as basal cell carcinoma or sebaceous gland carcinoma, infiltrating and destroying local tissue structures.

================================================================================
Question 439 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#2. A 2-year-old male child is brought to you with a complaint of drooping of the right eyelid since birth. His eye is half open during sleep, there is an absent lid crease, amblyopia, and poor levator function. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Congenital Ptosis
  Jaw winking ptosis
  Aponeurotic Ptosis
  Traumatic Ptosis
  Myasthenia Gravis

Explanation:
The key features—ptosis present since birth, an absent or poorly formed eyelid crease, and poor function of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle—are the classic triad for congenital ptosis, which results from developmental dystrophy of the levator muscle.

================================================================================
Question 440 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#3. In a Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) operation, the window in the lateral nasal wall is made at the:

Options:
  Ethmoidal sinus
✓ Middle meatus
  Superior meatus
  Inferior meatus
  Lacrimal fossa

Explanation:
DCR surgery creates a new drainage pathway for tears by making a connection (anastomosis) between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity through a bony opening (osteotomy) into the middle meatus.

================================================================================
Question 441 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#4. A young lady with blepharitis presents with a swelling on the right upper lid for the last one month. The most common painless lid swelling is:

Options:
✓ Chalazion
  Stye
  Cellulitis
  Zeiss Cyst
  Moll Cyst

Explanation:
A chalazion is a sterile, granulomatous inflammation caused by a blocked meibomian gland. It typically presents as a firm, non-tender, painless nodule within the eyelid, making it the most likely diagnosis for a painless swelling lasting a month. A stye (hordeolum) is an acute, painful infection.

================================================================================
Question 442 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#5. A 70-year-old lady has an ulcerated nodular mass on her right medial lower eyelid for the last 4 years. The central ulceration has raised rolled edges with dilated blood vessels over the lateral margins. Preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes are not palpable. The most likely diagnosis is:

Options:
✓ Basal Cell Carcinoma
  Cicatricial ectropion
  Paralytic ectropion
  Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma
  Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Explanation:
The clinical description of a long-standing, nodular mass with central ulceration, raised or 'rolled' edges, and telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels) is the classic presentation of a nodulo-ulcerative Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC).

================================================================================
Question 443 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#6. A 25-year-old female had a trauma to the right lower lid. Now she is unable to close the right eye fully, the lower eyelid margin is rotated outward, and there is a scar mark 2mm below the lower eyelid. What's the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Congenital ectropion
✓ Cicatricial ectropion
  Paralytic ectropion
  Senile ectropion
  Traumatic entropion

Explanation:
Cicatricial ectropion is the outward turning of the eyelid margin due to scarring and contracture of the skin. The history of trauma and the presence of a scar directly link the condition to a cicatricial cause.

================================================================================
Question 444 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#7. A 2-year-old female child is brought to you with a complaint of a white pupil and decrease of vision. You examine her and diagnose her as a case of congenital cataract. Which one is the most common presentation/type?

Options:
  Blue Dot
✓ Lamellar
  Nuclear
  Polar
  Sutural

Explanation:
While many morphological types exist, the lamellar (or zonular) cataract is the most common type of clinically significant congenital cataract, often affecting vision and requiring intervention.

================================================================================
Question 445 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#8. A 60-year-old man presented with a right eye cataract. You performed his biometry and calculated his IOL power. Which is the most important factor in IOL calculation?

Options:
  A Constant
✓ Axial Length
  B Scan
  Keratometry
  Tonometry

Explanation:
While both axial length and keratometry are critical for IOL power calculation, small errors in axial length measurement have a much greater impact on the final refractive outcome than errors in keratometry. Therefore, axial length is considered the most important factor.

================================================================================
Question 446 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#9. A patient presented with recurrent pterygium. Which of the following is the best management plan?

Options:
  Bare Sclera technique
  Excision with Conjunctival autograft
✓ Excision with MMC

Explanation:
For recurrent pterygium, simple excision has a high recurrence rate. Excision combined with a conjunctival autograft is the gold standard, as it provides the lowest recurrence rates by creating a barrier to fibrovascular regrowth. Mitomycin C (MMC) is also used but has a higher risk of complications like scleral melt.

================================================================================
Question 447 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#10. A patient presented with photophobia and decreased vision in the left eye. On examination, there is conjunctival circumferential congestion and a constricted pupil. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute congestive glaucoma
  Anterior uveitis
✓ Conjunctivitis

Explanation:
The triad of photophobia, ciliary (circumferential) congestion, and a constricted (miotic) pupil are classic signs of acute anterior uveitis (iritis). Acute glaucoma typically presents with a mid-dilated pupil, and conjunctivitis usually has diffuse congestion without significant pain or vision loss.

================================================================================
Question 448 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#11. All can be possible complications of CRVO except:

Options:
  Glaucoma
  Rubeosis iridis
  Macular edema
  Intraocular hemorrhage

Explanation:
Intraocular hemorrhage (specifically retinal hemorrhages) is a primary sign of Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO), not a complication that develops later. Macular edema, rubeosis iridis, and subsequent neovascular glaucoma are the major complications.

================================================================================
Question 449 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#12. All are risk factors for CRVO except:

Options:
  Oral Contraceptives
✓ Myopia
  Macroglobulinemia
  Diabetes mellitus

Explanation:
Systemic vascular diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and hyperviscosity states (e.g., macroglobulinemia) are major risk factors for CRVO. Myopia is a significant risk factor for retinal detachment and myopic macular degeneration, but not typically for CRVO.

================================================================================
Question 450 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#13. All can be the causes of an exudative retinal detachment except:

Options:
  Malignant melanoma
✓ High Myopia
  Diabetic retinopathy
  Posterior uveitis

Explanation:
Exudative retinal detachment is caused by fluid accumulating under the retina due to inflammation, tumors (melanoma), or vascular leakage (diabetic retinopathy). High myopia is a primary cause of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, which is caused by a retinal break or tear allowing vitreous fluid to seep underneath.

================================================================================
Question 451 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#14. All can be the signs of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment except:

Options:
✓ Raised IOP
  Mobile retina
  Retinal break

Explanation:
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is typically associated with low intraocular pressure (hypotony) due to ciliary body detachment or increased uveoscleral outflow. A raised IOP is not a characteristic sign. A retinal break and a mobile, undulating retina are hallmark features.

================================================================================
Question 452 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#15. All can be the causes of macular edema except:

Options:
  Cataract surgery
✓ High Myopia
  Diabetes
  Trauma

Explanation:
Macular edema can be caused by diabetes, post-cataract surgery (Irvine-Gass syndrome), and trauma. High myopia is associated with conditions like choroidal neovascularization or macular schisis, but it is not a direct cause of macular edema in the same way the other conditions are.

================================================================================
Question 453 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#16. All may be considered as treatment options for retinoblastoma except:

Options:
✓ Enucleation
  Laser Photocoagulation
  Brachytherapy

Explanation:
This question is ambiguous as enucleation, laser photocoagulation, and brachytherapy are all established treatment options for retinoblastoma, depending on the tumor's size, location, and stage. There is no clear 'exception' among the given choices. A definitive answer cannot be determined from the options provided.

================================================================================
Question 454 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#17. All are the tests for pre-perimetric glaucoma except:

Options:
  Visual Fields and Optic disc
  OCT optic disc and HRT
  Visual Fields and HRT
✓ OCT and Gonio

Explanation:
'Pre-perimetric' glaucoma means structural damage (like nerve fiber layer thinning) has occurred without detectable functional loss on a standard visual field test. OCT and HRT are key tests to detect this structural damage. Gonioscopy (Gonio) assesses the drainage angle to classify glaucoma type but doesn't detect pre-perimetric damage itself. Thus, the combination of OCT and Gonio is the exception.

================================================================================
Question 455 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#21. A 6-year-old male child is brought to the outdoor clinic with complaints of decrease of vision while looking at the whiteboard in school. Parents also noticed that the child stands very close to the television. You perform retinoscopy and there is a streak moving in the opposite direction. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Astigmatism
  Hyperopia
  Emmetropia
✓ Myopia
  Strabismus

Explanation:
The clinical history of difficulty with distance vision (whiteboard, television) is classic for myopia (nearsightedness). On retinoscopy, a streak of light moving 'against' or in the opposite direction of the retinoscope's movement confirms the diagnosis of myopia.

================================================================================
Question 456 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#22. You perform a retinoscopy of a patient complaining of decrease of vision. On retinoscopy the reflex moves with the movement. Which of the following is most likely false:

Options:
  Astigmatism
  Hyperopia
  Emmetropia
✓ Myopia greater than working distance

Explanation:
A 'with' movement in retinoscopy indicates hyperopia, emmetropia, or myopia that is less than the dioptric power of the working distance. A myopic eye with a refractive error greater than the working distance would produce an 'against' movement. Therefore, 'Myopia greater than working distance' is false.

================================================================================
Question 457 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#23. A 4-year-old child is brought to you with the complaints of deviation of eyes. On the extraocular movements, the eyes are moving fine. What is the next most important step in the management?

Options:
✓ Cycloplegic refraction
  Fundus examination
  Autorefraction
  Pupil reaction

Explanation:
In a child with strabismus (deviation of eyes), the most important next step is to perform a cycloplegic refraction. This paralyzes accommodation, allowing for an accurate measurement of the child's true refractive error. Uncorrected refractive errors, particularly hyperopia, are a common cause of accommodative esotropia.

================================================================================
Question 458 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#24. A patient presents with right ptosis and the condition is painful. He is recently diagnosed. There is right exotropia in primary position, the pupil is dilated and not responding to light. VA 6/6 BE and fundi are grossly normal. There is no past history of trauma. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Aneurysm of posterior cerebral artery
  Aneurysm of posterior communicating artery

Explanation:
This patient presents with a painful, pupil-involving third nerve palsy (ptosis, 'down and out' eye position/exotropia, dilated pupil). The parasympathetic fibers that constrict the pupil travel on the outside of the third nerve, making them susceptible to compression. A posterior communicating artery (PCOM) aneurysm is a classic cause of compressive, painful, pupil-involving third nerve palsy.

================================================================================
Question 459 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#25. All are the signs of acute iridocyclitis except:

Options:
  Aqueous flare
  Small pupil
  Limbal congestion
✓ Patch of iris atrophy

Explanation:
Aqueous flare (due to protein leakage), a small/miotic pupil (due to sphincter muscle spasm), and limbal/ciliary congestion are all classic signs of acute iridocyclitis (anterior uveitis). A patch of iris atrophy is typically a sign of previous inflammation or herpetic uveitis, not an acute sign.

================================================================================
Question 460 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#26. Anterior chamber is shallow in:

Options:
  Open angle glaucoma
  Aphakia
  Myopia
✓ Angle closure glaucoma

Explanation:
A shallow anterior chamber is the key anatomical predisposition for angle-closure glaucoma. In contrast, myopia and aphakia are associated with a deep anterior chamber, and open-angle glaucoma is not defined by anterior chamber depth.

================================================================================
Question 461 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#27. A 55-year-old hypertensive lady develops sudden loss of vision in her left eye. She has widespread flame-shaped hemorrhages in the retina. The most likely diagnosis is:

Options:
  Central retinal artery occlusion
  Diabetic retinopathy
✓ Central retinal vein occlusion

Explanation:
The presentation of sudden, painless vision loss with widespread flame-shaped hemorrhages throughout all four quadrants of the retina is the classic fundoscopic appearance of a Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). Hypertension is a major risk factor.

================================================================================
Question 462 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#28. Unequal size of two pupils is called as:

Options:
✓ Anisocoria
  Anisometropia
  Aniridia
  Heterochromia

Explanation:
Anisocoria is the medical term for unequal pupil sizes. Anisometropia is unequal refractive error, aniridia is absence of the iris, and heterochromia is a difference in iris color.

================================================================================
Question 463 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#29. Yellowish color of the macula is because of the presence of:

Options:
  Hemoglobin
  Fluorescein
  Melanin
✓ Xanthophyll pigments (Lutein and Zeaxanthin)

Explanation:
The macula lutea ('yellow spot') gets its characteristic yellowish color from high concentrations of xanthophyll carotenoid pigments, specifically lutein and zeaxanthin, which help filter blue light. As 'None of the above' is an option and the specific pigments are not listed, this is the most accurate answer. Assuming 'd' was intended to be the correct choice.

================================================================================
Question 464 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#31. A 70-year-old lady has a shiny nodular mass on her right lower eyelid for the last 4 months. The lesion is growing rapidly. Preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes are palpable. Histopathology shows keratin pearls. The most likely diagnosis is:

Options:
  Basal cell carcinoma
  Sebaceous gland carcinoma
  Kaposi Sarcoma
✓ Squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation:
While BCC is more common, the rapid growth, palpable lymph nodes (indicating metastasis), and especially the histopathological finding of 'keratin pearls' are characteristic features of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC).

================================================================================
Question 465 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#32. A 25-year-old male comes to the clinic with a 3-day history of painful swelling on his right upper lid margin. On examination, there is blepharitis, a red tender upper eyelid with an infected eyelash. What is your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Chalazion
  Haemangioma
  Dermoid Cyst
  Papilloma
✓ Stye

Explanation:
A stye, or external hordeolum, is an acute, painful staphylococcal infection of an eyelash follicle or its associated glands (Zeis or Moll). The description of a painful, red, tender swelling at the lid margin involving an eyelash is classic for a stye.

================================================================================
Question 466 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#33. A three-year-old child is presented with bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhages. He has been suffering from fever, severe cough, and chest infection. The commonest cause of subconjunctival hemorrhages in this case would be:

Options:
  Fever
✓ Severe Cough

Explanation:
Severe coughing fits cause a sudden increase in intrathoracic and venous pressure (a Valsalva-like maneuver), which can rupture the small, fragile conjunctival blood vessels, leading to a subconjunctival hemorrhage. The fever is part of the illness but the cough is the direct mechanical cause.

================================================================================
Question 467 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#34. An 8-year-old child is brought by his parents with chief complaints of mucopurulent discharge, redness, and swelling of both eyes for the last two months. On examination, there are follicles on the upper tarsal conjunctiva and a superior corneal pannus. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Allergic conjunctivitis
✓ Trachoma

Explanation:
The presence of follicles on the upper tarsal conjunctiva combined with the development of a superior corneal pannus (vascularization and scarring of the upper cornea) are pathognomonic signs of trachoma, a chronic conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.

================================================================================
Question 468 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#35. A house officer was asked about the causes of a dilated pupil. What is the most common cause of a dilated pupil seen in a clinical setting?

Options:
  Trauma
  Third cranial nerve palsy
✓ Pharmacological dilatation
  Acute angle closure glaucoma

Explanation:
In a general clinical or emergency setting, the most common reason for a patient to present with a fixed, dilated pupil is iatrogenic—the intentional use of mydriatic (dilating) eye drops like tropicamide or cyclopentolate for a fundus examination.

================================================================================
Question 469 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#36. A 7-year-old child presents every spring season for the last 4 years with itching, redness, and watering. There are no follicles but papillae on both upper tarsal conjunctivae. There are no preauricular lymph nodes. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Adenoviral conjunctivitis
  Bacterial conjunctivitis
✓ Vernal keratoconjunctivitis

Explanation:
The combination of severe itching, a seasonal (spring) recurrence, and the presence of giant papillae ('cobblestone' appearance) on the upper tarsal conjunctiva are the hallmark features of Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), a severe form of allergic conjunctivitis.

================================================================================
Question 470 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#37. A patient presented with photophobia and watering in the left eye for the last week. On examination with fluorescein, a dendritic ulcer was revealed. This is caused by:

Options:
  Fungus
  Herpes zoster virus
✓ Herpes simplex virus

Explanation:
A dendritic ulcer, which has a characteristic branching, tree-like pattern when stained with fluorescein, is the pathognomonic sign of active epithelial keratitis caused by the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV).

================================================================================
Question 471 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#38. A young boy presented in the emergency department with watering and photophobia in his right eye after a trauma. Which test is most appropriate?

Options:
  Applanation tonometry
✓ Fluorescein staining
  Rose Bengal staining
  Schirmer's test

Explanation:
After an eye trauma, symptoms of watering and photophobia are highly suggestive of a corneal abrasion. Fluorescein staining is the essential diagnostic test to visualize any epithelial defects on the cornea, which will stain bright green under a cobalt blue light.

================================================================================
Question 472 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#40. A 15-year-old boy presents with progressive decrease in vision. He suffers from vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Which medication is likely responsible for his vision loss?

Options:
  Dexamethasone

Explanation:
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is often treated with topical steroids like Dexamethasone. Long-term steroid use is a well-known cause of posterior subcapsular cataracts and elevated intraocular pressure (steroid-induced glaucoma), both of which can lead to a progressive decrease in vision.

================================================================================
Question 473 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#41. A 30-year-old man, while working in a factory, suffered an electric shock but survived. What could be the most possible effect on his eye?

Options:
✓ Bilateral cataracts

Explanation:
A high-voltage electric shock can cause a specific type of cataract, often developing months to years after the injury. The cataracts are typically bilateral and may have a characteristic snowflake or diffuse milky appearance.

================================================================================
Question 474 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#42. The test used to calculate the power of the intraocular lens prior to cataract surgery is:

Options:
  B-Scan
✓ Biometry

Explanation:
Ocular biometry is the process of measuring the eye's characteristics—specifically axial length and corneal curvature (keratometry)—to calculate the appropriate power for the intraocular lens (IOL) implant.

================================================================================
Question 475 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#43. A 55-year-old lady suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. She has developed intensely painful red eyes. Visual acuity is 6/12 with pinhole. In her left eye, she has a red nodular swelling approximately 2mm from the limbus. The swelling is tender and fixed and does not blanch with the use of phenylephrine. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Scleritis
  Episcleritis

Explanation:
The key features are severe, deep pain, a nodular swelling of the deep vessels that does not blanch with topical phenylephrine, and an association with a systemic autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis). These are classic signs of nodular scleritis. Episcleritis is less painful, involves superficial vessels that do blanch, and is often idiopathic.

================================================================================
Question 476 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#44. In a non-healing, sloughing corneal ulcer where perforation is expected, what is the best management?

Options:
  Scrapping of the cornea
✓ Conjunctival flap

Explanation:
When a corneal ulcer is non-healing and perforation is imminent, a conjunctival flap (Gundersen flap) can be used as a tectonic support. It brings a vascular supply to the area, promotes healing, and provides a physical barrier to cover the thinned cornea or seal a small perforation.

================================================================================
Question 477 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#45. A female of 40 years presents with painless decrease of vision for four years. The patient has myopia with irregular astigmatism. There is thinning of the central cornea. The most sensitive investigation for this patient is:

Options:
  Refraction
  Ocular biometry
✓ Corneal Topography/Tomography

Explanation:
The combination of progressive myopia, irregular astigmatism, and central corneal thinning is highly suggestive of keratoconus. Corneal topography or tomography is the most sensitive investigation to diagnose early or subclinical keratoconus by mapping the corneal curvature and thickness.

================================================================================
Question 478 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#46. A 4-year-old child is brought by her mother with bilateral white pupils. Anterior segment and pupillary reactions are normal. Ultrasound B-scan was performed and was found to be normal. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Bilateral congenital cataracts
  Bilateral retinoblastoma

Explanation:
Bilateral leukocoria (white pupils) in a child can be caused by cataracts or retinoblastoma. Since the B-scan ultrasound, which is used to detect intraocular masses like retinoblastoma, was normal, the most probable diagnosis is bilateral congenital cataracts.

================================================================================
Question 479 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#47. A patient who was operated for a cataract four months back comes to you with foggy vision. On examination, there was posterior capsular thickening. Which mode of treatment is most useful?

Options:
  Argon laser
  YAG-laser

Explanation:
Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is a common complication after cataract surgery, causing foggy vision. The standard treatment is a Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, where the YAG laser is used to create a clear opening in the center of the opacified posterior capsule.

================================================================================
Question 480 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#48. What is the best option for treating a unilateral cataract in a young adult with unaided visual acuity of 6/6 in the other eye?

Options:
  Phacoemulsification and IOL implantation

Explanation:
In a young adult, correcting a unilateral cataract without an intraocular lens (IOL) would result in aphakia and significant anisometropia, which is intolerable. The standard of care and best option is to remove the cataract via phacoemulsification and implant an IOL to restore clear, focused vision.

================================================================================
Question 481 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#49. A child is hit in the eye by a used disposable syringe by his younger brother 2 days back. He is brought by his parents to the OPD with a painful red eye. His eyelids are swollen, there is ciliary congestion, a hazy cornea, and hypopyon. The pupil is yellowish-white and there is no fundus reflex. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Endophthalmitis

Explanation:
The history of a penetrating injury (syringe) followed by severe pain, vision loss, eyelid swelling, hazy cornea, and hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber) are classic signs of post-traumatic endophthalmitis, a severe intraocular infection. This is an ophthalmologic emergency.

================================================================================
Question 482 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#50. A 35-year-old female presents to the OPD with dimness of vision in the right eye for one year. She gives a history of right cataract extraction but the record is not available. Clinically, visual acuity in the right eye is CF 2m & 6/6 in the left eye. There is now right aphakia with an intact posterior capsule. What is the most appropriate method for restoration of vision in the right eye?

Options:
  Right secondary posterior chamber IOL implantation

Explanation:
The patient is aphakic (missing the lens) but has an intact posterior capsule, which provides crucial support. The best way to restore vision is by implanting a secondary intraocular lens (IOL). Placing it in the posterior chamber (ideally in the sulcus) is the most anatomically sound and stable option.

================================================================================
Question 483 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#51. A one-year-old boy is brought to the OPD by his parents. The doctor diagnosed him as having congenital cataracts. What will happen if his cataracts are not removed at the earliest?

Options:
✓ He will develop stimulus deprivation amblyopia
  He will develop phthisis bulbi

Explanation:
During the critical period of visual development in infancy, a clear retinal image is necessary for the visual pathways to mature. A dense congenital cataract blocks this image, leading to severe and often irreversible stimulus deprivation amblyopia ('lazy eye') if not removed promptly.

================================================================================
Question 484 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#52. The best emergent treatment of an alkali burn at the site of injury is:

Options:
  Wash the eye with vinegar to neutralize alkali
  Immediately irrigate with copious amounts of water or saline

Explanation:
The immediate, critical first step for any chemical burn to the eye, especially alkali burns, is prolonged and copious irrigation with sterile saline or clean water for at least 15-30 minutes. This dilutes and washes away the chemical to minimize damage. Attempting neutralization is dangerous and can cause further injury.

================================================================================
Question 485 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#53. A patient has blunt trauma with a tennis ball and is found to have a hyphema. What is a hyphema?

Options:
✓ Blood in the anterior chamber
  Protein in the anterior chamber

Explanation:
A hyphema is the medical term for blood collecting in the anterior chamber of the eye, the space between the cornea and the iris. It is a common result of blunt-force trauma.

================================================================================
Question 486 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#54. A 13-year-old boy is brought to an ophthalmologist with pain and diffuse swelling of the right upper lid. The boy is febrile and the upper lid area is red, swollen, and tender. The eye itself is white. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Amyloidosis of the lids
  Preseptal cellulitis

Explanation:
Preseptal cellulitis is an infection of the eyelid and soft tissues anterior to the orbital septum. It is characterized by lid edema, erythema, and tenderness. Crucially, the globe itself is not involved, so vision, pupillary reactions, and eye movements are normal, and the eye is 'white' (not congested).

================================================================================
Question 487 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#55. A 32-year-old male presents with a red eye. He was referred to the ophthalmologist with a suspicion of uveitis. The most reliable sign for diagnosing acute anterior uveitis is:

Options:
  Keratic precipitates (KPs) on the Endothelium

Explanation:
While many signs are present in anterior uveitis, the presence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber is definitive. These cells can be seen as keratic precipitates (KPs), which are clumps of inflammatory cells stuck to the inner surface of the cornea (the endothelium), and are a hallmark sign of uveitis.

================================================================================
Question 488 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#56. The treatment of intraocular malignant melanoma of the uvea is:

Options:
✓ Enucleation
  Chemotherapy
  Evisceration
  Radiotherapy
  Exenteration

Explanation:
For large uveal melanomas where vision cannot be salvaged, or for tumors that do not respond to other treatments, enucleation (complete removal of the eyeball) has historically been the standard treatment to prevent metastasis. Radiotherapy (e.g., plaque brachytherapy) is now a primary treatment for small to medium-sized tumors to preserve the eye.

================================================================================
Question 489 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#57. The Hirschberg test is used to detect:

Options:
✓ Squint
  Optic atrophy
  Field defect
  Cataract

Explanation:
The Hirschberg test, or corneal light reflex test, is a simple screening tool used to assess ocular alignment and detect the presence of strabismus (squint). It involves observing the position of the light reflex from a penlight on the corneas of both eyes.

================================================================================
Question 490 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#58. Trichiasis is:

Options:
✓ Misdirection of eyelashes toward the globe

Explanation:
Trichiasis is the misdirection of eyelashes, causing them to grow inwards and rub against the cornea and conjunctiva, leading to irritation, pain, and potential corneal damage.

================================================================================
Question 491 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#59. The commonest feature of open-angle glaucoma is:

Options:
  Asymptomatic

Explanation:
Primary open-angle glaucoma is often called the 'silent thief of sight' because it is typically asymptomatic in its early to moderate stages. Patients do not experience pain or noticeable vision loss until significant, irreversible peripheral visual field damage has occurred.

================================================================================
Question 492 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#60. The treatment of choice in recently diagnosed early open-angle glaucoma is:

Options:
  Prostaglandin analogs

Explanation:
Prostaglandin analogs (e.g., latanoprost) are generally considered the first-line medical treatment for open-angle glaucoma. They are highly effective at lowering IOP, have a convenient once-daily dosing schedule, and have a favorable side-effect profile compared to older medications like beta-blockers.

================================================================================
Question 493 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#61. The most common indication for cataract surgery is:

Options:
  Patient unable to perform daily activities

Explanation:
The primary indication for cataract surgery is when the patient's visual impairment from the cataract begins to interfere with their quality of life and ability to perform daily activities such as reading, driving, or recognizing faces. It is a functional, rather than numerical, indication.

================================================================================
Question 494 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#62. Which of the following is the best management of congenital glaucoma:

Options:
  Surgery

Explanation:
Congenital glaucoma is a surgical disease. Medical therapy is only a temporary measure to control intraocular pressure before surgery. The definitive treatment involves angle surgery, such as goniotomy or trabeculotomy, to improve the aqueous outflow.

================================================================================
Question 495 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#63. A patient undergoes a combined cataract and filtering procedure. On the first postoperative day, the patient has an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 43 with a chamber that is flat peripherally and very shallow centrally with no lens-corneal touch. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Malignant glaucoma (Aqueous misdirection)

Explanation:
The combination of a very high IOP with a uniformly shallow or flat anterior chamber after intraocular surgery is the classic presentation of malignant glaucoma, also known as aqueous misdirection syndrome. This occurs when aqueous humor is misdirected posteriorly into the vitreous cavity, pushing the lens-iris diaphragm forward.

================================================================================
Question 496 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#64. What is one of the factors that minimize surgically induced astigmatism when performing surgery?

Options:
✓ Size and location of the wound

Explanation:
Surgically induced astigmatism is directly related to the corneal incision. Smaller incisions (as in modern phacoemulsification) and incisions placed more peripherally or on the sclera induce less astigmatism. The size and location of the wound are critical factors.

================================================================================
Question 497 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#65. A patient with pseudoexfoliation syndrome is at increased risk for which of the following complications?

Options:
✓ Zonular damage during cataract surgery

Explanation:
Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is characterized by the deposition of fibrillar material throughout the eye, including on the lens zonules. This causes the zonules to become weak and brittle, significantly increasing the risk of zonular dehiscence, capsular bag instability, and vitreous loss during cataract surgery.

================================================================================
Question 498 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#66. A patient with pseudoexfoliation and a very large, hard, brunescent nuclear sclerotic cataract has marked pseudodonesis and more than 180 degrees of zonular dehiscence. What is the best surgical approach?

Options:
  Phacoemulsification employing a capsular tension ring

Explanation:
In cases with significant zonular weakness or dehiscence (as indicated by pseudodonesis), a capsular tension ring (CTR) is essential. The CTR is inserted into the capsular bag to provide circumferential support, stabilize the bag, and allow for safer phacoemulsification and secure in-the-bag IOL placement.

================================================================================
Question 499 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#67. What is the best management for phacolytic glaucoma?

Options:
  Cataract extraction

Explanation:
Phacolytic glaucoma is a secondary open-angle glaucoma caused by high-molecular-weight lens proteins leaking from a hypermature cataract, which then clog the trabecular meshwork. The definitive treatment is to remove the source of the proteins by performing cataract extraction. Medical therapy is used pre-operatively to control IOP.

================================================================================
Question 500 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#68. For any given diopter power, the higher the refractive index, the thinner the intraocular lens optic. Which of the following currently available intraocular lens optic materials possesses the highest refractive index?

Options:
✓ Hydrophobic acrylic

Explanation:
Different IOL materials have different refractive indices. Of the commonly used materials, hydrophobic acrylic generally has the highest refractive index (around 1.55), which allows for a thinner lens profile compared to materials like PMMA or silicone with lower indices.

================================================================================
Question 501 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#69. Which of the following sequelae of a carotid cavernous sinus fistula is the most common cause of visual disability?

Options:
  Glaucoma

Explanation:
A carotid-cavernous fistula causes high pressure in the cavernous sinus, which leads to elevated episcleral venous pressure. This, in turn, severely impairs aqueous outflow and causes a significant, often difficult-to-treat, secondary glaucoma, which is a major cause of vision loss.

================================================================================
Question 502 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#70. During a consultation in the emergency room, you are asked to see a patient with non-infected 2nd-degree burns to the eyelids. The emergency room physicians ask what topical medicine should be placed on the burns to prevent scarring. What would be the most appropriate response?

Options:
  Lubricating ointment

Explanation:
For eyelid burns, the primary goal is to keep the tissue moist to promote healing and prevent contracture and scarring. A bland lubricating ointment (like an antibiotic ointment for prophylaxis) serves this purpose well. There are no specific medications that can 'prevent' scarring in this context.

================================================================================
Question 503 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#71. A 56-year-old man complains of pain around his left eye that has lasted for 2 weeks. The pain increases on extraocular movement. One week ago, he noted blurred vision in the left eye and a slight fever. His visual acuity is 20/40 OD and 20/40 OS. The patient has 5 mm of proptosis in the left eye with erythema and tenderness around the left eyelid. Results of biomicroscopy and dilated fundus examination are normal. What is the most helpful diagnostic test for this patient?

Options:
✓ CT scan of the orbits

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms—proptosis, pain on eye movement, and eyelid erythema—are classic signs of an orbital inflammatory process or mass. A CT scan of the orbits is the most helpful initial diagnostic test to visualize the orbital soft tissues, extraocular muscles, and optic nerve to identify the cause, such as orbital cellulitis, abscess, or orbital pseudotumor.

================================================================================
Question 504 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#72. What is the best way to distinguish a restrictive motility disorder from a paretic disorder after an orbital floor fracture?

Options:
  Forced-duction testing

Explanation:
Forced-duction testing is a clinical maneuver where the anesthetized eye is physically moved with forceps. If movement is limited (a positive test), it indicates a restrictive problem, such as muscle entrapment in a fracture. If the eye moves freely, the limitation is due to a paretic (nerve palsy) cause.

================================================================================
Question 505 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#73. What are the 2 most commonly affected rectus muscles in thyroid eye disease?

Options:
  Inferior and medial

Explanation:
In thyroid eye disease (Graves' orbitopathy), the extraocular muscles become inflamed and enlarged. The involvement follows a typical pattern, remembered by the mnemonic 'I'M SLOW': Inferior rectus, Medial rectus, Superior rectus, Lateral rectus, Obliques. Thus, the inferior and medial recti are the most commonly affected.

================================================================================
Question 506 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#74. What is the most common organism implicated in dacryocystitis?

Options:
  Staphylococcus aureus

Explanation:
Acute dacryocystitis (infection of the lacrimal sac) is most commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria, with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most frequent isolates.

================================================================================
Question 507 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#75. In diabetic retinopathy, the most important feature of the pre-proliferative stage includes:

Options:
  Cotton wool spots

Explanation:
Pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PPDR) is characterized by signs of increasing retinal ischemia. Cotton wool spots (nerve fiber layer infarcts), venous beading, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) are key features that signify progression from non-proliferative to this more advanced stage.

================================================================================
Question 508 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#76. Regarding hypertensive retinopathy, which of the following is least likely a sign of severe or malignant stage changes:

Options:
  Arteriolar narrowing

Explanation:
Generalized or focal arteriolar narrowing is one of the earliest signs of hypertensive retinopathy (Grade 1-2). Severe or malignant stage changes (Grade 4) are characterized by more advanced signs like flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and optic disc swelling (papilledema).

================================================================================
Question 509 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#77. The earliest symptom of nuclear sclerosis after middle age may be:

Options:
  Second sight (myopic shift)

Explanation:
Nuclear sclerosis is a type of cataract where the central part of the lens hardens and increases in refractive index. This causes a myopic shift, where a previously presbyopic or hyperopic patient may find they can read again without glasses. This phenomenon is known as 'second sight'.

================================================================================
Question 510 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#78. Being able to see only Schwalbe's line on gonioscopy means that the angle is:

Options:
✓ Closed

Explanation:
In gonioscopy, if only Schwalbe's line (the most anterior structure) is visible, it means all the functional parts of the angle (trabecular meshwork, scleral spur, ciliary body) are obscured by the peripheral iris. This corresponds to a Grade 0 or closed angle.

================================================================================
Question 511 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#79. Which of the following visual field defects is most characteristically seen in optic neuritis?

Options:
  Central scotoma

Explanation:
Optic neuritis typically involves inflammation of the papillomacular bundle of the optic nerve, which carries signals from the macula. This results in a characteristic central or cecocentral scotoma (a blind spot in the center of the visual field).

================================================================================
Question 512 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#80. All of the following are types of amblyopia except:

Options:
  Anisometropic

Explanation:
Strabismic, anisometropic, and stimulus deprivation are the major types of amblyopia. Ammetropic amblyopia, referring to amblyopia from high but equal refractive error in both eyes (e.g., high hyperopia), is also a recognized type. The question likely contains a typo, but based on common classifications, all listed options are forms or causes of amblyopia. However, if 'Ammetropic' and 'Anisometropic' are considered, 'Ammetropic' is a less commonly used term, making it the most likely intended 'except' option.

================================================================================
Question 513 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#81. With direct ophthalmoscopy, which of the following structures are seen?

Options:
  Retina

Explanation:
Direct ophthalmoscopy provides a highly magnified, upright, monocular view of the fundus. This allows for detailed examination of the posterior pole structures, including the retina, optic disc, macula, and retinal blood vessels.

================================================================================
Question 514 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#82. A neurogenic cause of ptosis is:

Options:
  Third nerve palsy

Explanation:
Neurogenic ptosis is caused by a problem with the nerve supply to the eyelid muscles. The oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve) innervates the levator palpebrae superioris, the main muscle for eyelid elevation. A palsy of this nerve is a classic neurogenic cause of ptosis.

================================================================================
Question 515 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#83. Which of the following surgical instruments is used in Chalazion surgery?

Options:
  Chalazion clamp and curette

Explanation:
Incision and curettage of a chalazion requires specific instruments. A chalazion clamp (e.g., Desmarres or Lambert) is used to evert the eyelid and provide hemostasis, while a chalazion curette is a small scoop used to remove the granulomatous contents of the lesion. A 'wire vectus' is used in cataract surgery.

================================================================================
Question 516 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#84. Which of the following is not routinely used in ophthalmology:

Options:
  Punch

Explanation:
While various needles, sutures (like Nylon and Vicryl), and forceps are fundamental to ophthalmic surgery, a 'punch' is not a standard or routinely used instrument in most common procedures. Punches are more associated with procedures like dermal biopsies or sclerostomy in older glaucoma surgeries.

================================================================================
Question 517 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#85. As a fourth-year student, ophthalmology and ophthalmologists inspired you a lot due to elective. They have a clean bloodless surgical field, good income, and a high number of patients. Still, you opted for a general surgery profession. What is a common perceived downside of ophthalmology?

Options:
  Too much saturation

Explanation:
This is a subjective question about career choice. While ophthalmology has many benefits, a common perception among medical students is that it is a highly competitive specialty with a limited number of training spots and that the field may be 'saturated' in desirable practice locations, making it difficult to establish a new practice.

================================================================================
Question 518 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#86. The most common cause of gradual, painless decrease of vision in old age is:

Options:
  Cataract

Explanation:
Age-related cataract is the leading cause of reversible blindness worldwide. It causes a progressive, painless clouding of the natural lens, leading to a gradual decline in vision, glare, and changes in color perception in the elderly.

================================================================================
Question 519 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#87. The insufficiency of accommodation that leads to a decrease in near vision after 40 years of age is called:

Options:
  Presbyopia

Explanation:
Presbyopia is the age-related physiological process where the crystalline lens loses its flexibility, diminishing the eye's ability to accommodate or focus on near objects. This typically becomes noticeable around the age of 40.

================================================================================
Question 520 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#88. A lesion in the optic tract results in:

Options:
✓ Homonymous hemianopia

Explanation:
The optic tract contains nerve fibers from the temporal half of the ipsilateral retina and the nasal half of the contralateral retina. A lesion in the optic tract (posterior to the chiasm) will therefore cause a visual field defect affecting the same half (e.g., the right half) of the visual field in both eyes, which is called a contralateral homonymous hemianopia.

================================================================================
Question 521 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#89. A current epidemic in which eyes are swollen, red, congested, and watery, affecting all family members, is likely due to:

Options:
  Adenovirus

Explanation:
Adenovirus is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis and is responsible for epidemics of 'pink eye'. It is highly contagious, leading to rapid spread among close contacts like family members, and presents with redness, watering, and sometimes swelling.

================================================================================
Question 522 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#90. All of the following are complications of vernal keratoconjunctivitis except:

Options:
✓ Cataract

Explanation:
Complications of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) itself include shield ulcers, corneal scarring, and keratoconus. However, cataracts are not a direct complication of the disease process. They are a well-known complication of the long-term topical steroid treatment often required to manage severe VKC.

================================================================================
Question 523 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#91. A 56-year-old diabetic patient presented with decreased vision in both eyes for the last one year. On examination, the anterior segment was normal. Fundoscopy showed retinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants with macular edema. How will you measure the macular edema in this patient?

Options:
  OCT scan of the macula

Explanation:
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the gold standard for diagnosing and quantifying macular edema. It provides high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina, allowing for precise measurement of retinal thickness and visualization of intraretinal cysts.

================================================================================
Question 524 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#92. A 15-year-old girl presents to the eye clinic with a 2-day history of blurring in the right eye with pain on ocular movements. Examination reveals a visual acuity of 6/36 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. There is a RAPD. Fundus examination shows a right swollen optic disc. The left fundus is normal. Systemic history and examination are not abnormal. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?

Options:
  Optic neuritis

Explanation:
The classic triad of symptoms for optic neuritis is acute unilateral vision loss, pain on eye movement, and impaired color vision. The key signs are a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) and a swollen optic disc (papillitis). This presentation in a young person is highly characteristic of optic neuritis.

================================================================================
Question 525 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#93. A 35-year-old male presented to Eye OPD with sudden loss of vision in his right eye. He has a history of trauma to the right eye with a cricket ball 2 months ago. On examination, his visual acuity is 6/36 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. He is having a RAPD. What is the likely cause of his right eye RAPD?

Options:
✓ Retinal detachment

Explanation:
A Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) indicates significant damage to the optic nerve or a widespread retinal pathology. A large retinal detachment, especially one involving the macula, can cause enough photoreceptor dysfunction to produce a RAPD. Given the history of severe blunt trauma, a traumatic retinal detachment is a very likely cause.

================================================================================
Question 526 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#94. A 68-year-old woman came to you with difficulty in reading. She is non-diabetic and non-hypertensive. On examination, VA in both eyes is 6/6 for distance. Ocular examination is unremarkable. What is the cause of her reduced near vision?

Options:
  Presbyopia

Explanation:
The patient has excellent distance vision but difficulty with near vision (reading), which is the classic symptom of presbyopia. This is the age-related decline in the eye's ability to accommodate, making it difficult to focus on close objects. At age 68, this is an expected physiological change.

================================================================================
Question 527 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#95. A 60-year-old uncontrolled diabetic woman presented with sudden decreased vision in her right eye. On examination, there are bilateral cataracts. There is no RAPD. The fundus view is not clear. What investigation will you advise to assess any associated posterior segment pathology?

Options:
  B-scan ultrasonography

Explanation:
When the view of the posterior segment is obscured by a dense cataract, B-scan ultrasonography is the investigation of choice. It uses sound waves to create a two-dimensional image of the structures inside the eye, allowing for the detection of pathologies like retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage.

================================================================================
Question 528 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#96. A 60-year-old man presented to you with watering and redness in both eyes for the last year. He had a previous history of bacterial conjunctivitis. On examination, you found inward rotation of the lower eyelids. What is your Diagnosis?

Options:
  Lower lid entropion

Explanation:
Entropion is the inward turning of the eyelid margin. This causes the eyelashes to rub against the cornea (trichiasis), leading to chronic irritation, redness, and watering (epiphora).

================================================================================
Question 529 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#97. A 58-year-old man underwent uneventful phacoemulsification surgery for a cataract in his right eye. After 3 days, he presented with severe pain and loss of vision in the right eye. On examination, he was having VA of perception of light in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. He has a congested conjunctiva, hazy cornea, and hypopyon with no view of the posterior segment of the eye. Which is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Endophthalmitis

Explanation:
The acute onset of severe pain, profound vision loss, and signs of intense intraocular inflammation (hazy cornea, hypopyon) within days of cataract surgery is the classic presentation of acute postoperative endophthalmitis. This is a devastating intraocular infection and an ophthalmologic emergency.

================================================================================
Question 530 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#98. A 30-year-old man presents to Eye OPD with epiphora and bilateral drowsy eyelids which worsen in the evenings. There is also a history of fatigability. On examination, his visual acuity is 6/6 in both eyes. Anterior and posterior segment examination is unremarkable. There is bilateral ptosis partially obstructing the visual axis and 20 prism diopter esotropia. Which of the following tests would you perform next?

Options:
  Ice pack test

Explanation:
The symptoms of ptosis and diplopia that worsen with fatigue (diurnal variation) are highly suggestive of Myasthenia Gravis. The ice pack test is a simple, quick clinical test for myasthenia. Cooling the eyelid improves neuromuscular transmission, and a positive test shows a temporary improvement in the ptosis.

================================================================================
Question 531 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#99. A 40-year-old male presented to OPD with sudden blurring of vision in his right eye. VA right eye 6/12 and VA left eye 6/6. On fundus examination, there is superior temporal venous engorgement, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Branch retinal vein occlusion

Explanation:
The fundoscopic findings of hemorrhages, venous engorgement, and cotton wool spots are confined to a specific quadrant (superior temporal). This sectoral pattern is characteristic of a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO), where a branch of the central retinal vein is occluded, typically at an arteriovenous crossing.

================================================================================
Question 532 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#100. A 65-year-old patient presented with vertical diplopia for the last 5 days. He has a history of a road traffic accident 1 week ago. On examination, vision in both eyes is 6/6. There is hypertropia of the right eye, and the patient cannot depress the eye in adduction. Which nerve is most probably involved?

Options:
  Trochlear nerve

Explanation:
The trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) innervates the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for intorsion and depression of the eye, especially when the eye is adducted (moved inward). A palsy of this nerve leads to vertical diplopia and hypertropia, with a characteristic inability to depress the adducted eye. It is very vulnerable to traumatic injury.

================================================================================
Question 533 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#101. A 6-month-old infant is brought by parents with complaints of watering, redness, photophobia, and not fixing and following light with the right eye. On examination, he has nystagmus with an enlarged, hazy cornea. IOP is 30 in the right eye and 8 in the left eye. Left eye examination is unremarkable. How will you treat this patient?

Options:
  Trabeculectomy or Goniotomy

Explanation:
The signs of photophobia, epiphora (watering), enlarged hazy cornea (buphthalmos), and high IOP are classic for congenital glaucoma. This is a surgical emergency. The definitive treatment is angle surgery, typically a goniotomy or trabeculotomy, to improve aqueous outflow and normalize the pressure.

================================================================================
Question 534 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#102. A 2-week-old infant is brought to eye OPD with a white pupillary reflex in both eyes since birth and a left eye microcornea. There is no view of the posterior segment. What is the most important immediate step?

Options:
  Urgent referral for examination under anesthesia

Explanation:
Bilateral leukocoria (white reflex) in a newborn is an ocular emergency. The differential includes congenital cataracts, retinoblastoma, and other serious conditions. An urgent referral for an examination under anesthesia (EUA) is required to establish a definitive diagnosis (with ultrasound and detailed exam) and plan immediate management to prevent irreversible vision loss.

================================================================================
Question 535 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#103. A 60-year-old male presented to you with a sudden, profound loss of vision in his left eye. On examination, you find a 'cherry red spot' on the fundus. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Central retinal artery occlusion

Explanation:
A 'cherry red spot' at the macula is the pathognomonic sign of a Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO). It occurs because the ischemic inner retina becomes pale and opaque, contrasting with the reddish color of the underlying choroid, which remains visible through the thin, separately-supplied fovea.

================================================================================
Question 536 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#104. A 65-year-old hypertensive patient presented with decreased vision in both eyes. Visual field examination is consistent with a right homonymous hemianopia. Which is the most likely location of the lesion?

Options:
  Left optic tract

Explanation:
A homonymous hemianopia is a visual field loss on the same side of both eyes (e.g., the right side of vision is gone in both the left and right eye). This type of defect is always caused by a lesion in the retrochiasmal pathway (optic tract, radiation, or visual cortex). A right homonymous hemianopia is caused by a lesion in the left side of the brain, such as the left optic tract.

================================================================================
Question 537 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#105. A 12-year-old child was brought to you with complaints of itchy eyes that are most severe in the summer season and are recurrent. On examination, the child is having VA of 6/18 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye. He is having papillae on the upper palpebral conjunctiva, and perilimbal congestion with small follicles (Trantas dots). What is the most probable diagnosis in this case?

Options:
✓ Vernal keratoconjunctivitis

Explanation:
The combination of severe itching, seasonal recurrence (summer/spring), giant papillae on the upper tarsus, and perilimbal Horner-Trantas dots are all classic and pathognomonic features of Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC).

================================================================================
Question 538 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#106. A 70-year-old woman came to OPD with sudden decreased vision in her left eye with an associated headache. The patient was also complaining of jaw claudication and pain on combing her hair. On examination, her visual acuity in the left eye is 6/60 and in the right eye is 6/6. Her ESR was 60. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy

Explanation:
The presentation of sudden, severe vision loss in an elderly patient, combined with systemic symptoms of giant cell arteritis (headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness) and a high ESR, is classic for Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (A-AION). This is a medical emergency requiring immediate high-dose systemic steroids.

================================================================================
Question 539 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#107. A 65-year-old man presented with decreased vision in both eyes for the last 2 years. On examination, he has a visual acuity of CF 3 meters in both eyes. On examination, the anterior segment is normal in both eyes and there is retinal pigment epithelial atrophy with scars in the macular region. He is non-diabetic and non-hypertensive. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Age-related macular degeneration

Explanation:
The gradual bilateral central vision loss in an elderly patient with findings of macular RPE atrophy and scarring is the classic presentation of the advanced 'dry' or atrophic form of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

================================================================================
Question 540 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#108. A 30-year-old female presented to eye OPD with sudden onset redness in the right eye (RE) with photophobia and decreased vision. Systemic history is positive for low back pain. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/18 in RE. There is conjunctival congestion, keratic precipitates (KPs), and cells in the anterior chamber. Fundus examination is unremarkable. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute Anterior Uveitis

Explanation:
The ocular signs—photophobia, decreased vision, KPs, and anterior chamber cells—are definitive for acute anterior uveitis. The association with low back pain suggests a systemic inflammatory condition like ankylosing spondylitis, which is strongly linked to this type of uveitis.

================================================================================
Question 541 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#109. A 55-year-old woman presented with pain in the left eye since yesterday. She is giving a history of left phacoemulsification 3 days back. On examination, the eye is counting fingers in the left eye with conjunctival congestion and corneal edema along with hypopyon in the anterior chamber. What is the most appropriate treatment?

Options:
✓ Intravitreal antibiotics

Explanation:
The patient has acute post-operative endophthalmitis. This is an ocular emergency requiring immediate treatment to save the eye. The standard of care is an urgent vitreous tap for culture and injection of broad-spectrum intravitreal antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin and ceftazidime).

================================================================================
Question 542 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#110. A 55-year-old female patient presented with decreased vision in the left eye along with a complaint of watering from the left eye. On examination, you found that the patient is having a mature cataract in the left eye with a positive regurgitation test of mucopurulent discharge on the same side. Which procedure will you prefer to do first?

Options:
  Treat the lacrimal sac infection before cataract surgery

Explanation:
A positive regurgitation test indicates chronic dacryocystitis (infection of the lacrimal sac). Performing intraocular surgery like cataract removal in the presence of an active infection is an absolute contraindication due to the extremely high risk of post-operative endophthalmitis. The infection must be treated first, often requiring a DCR surgery.

================================================================================
Question 543 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#111. A 4-month-old infant is brought by parents to Eye OPD with a white pupillary reflex in the right eye since birth. The infant is not fixing and following light with the right eye. EUA reveals retinoblastoma with a retro-lental mass with vitreous seeds in the right eye. Intraocular pressure is 35 in the right eye and 8 in the left eye. Left eye examination is unremarkable. MRI shows no invasion of the optic nerve. How will you treat this patient?

Options:
  Enucleation

Explanation:
In unilateral, advanced retinoblastoma with poor visual potential, high IOP (neovascular glaucoma), and vitreous seeding, enucleation (surgical removal of the eye) is the standard treatment. It is life-saving, removes the tumor completely, and prevents metastatic spread.

================================================================================
Question 544 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#112. A 6-month-old infant is brought by parents with complaints of watering, redness, photophobia, and not fixing and following light with the right eye. On examination, he has nystagmus with an enlarged, hazy cornea. Fundus examination is not possible due to poor view. IOP is 30 in the right eye under sedation. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Congenital glaucoma

Explanation:
The classic triad of epiphora (watering), photophobia, and blepharospasm, combined with the signs of an enlarged, hazy cornea (buphthalmos and corneal edema) and elevated IOP, is pathognomonic for congenital glaucoma.

================================================================================
Question 545 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#113. A 50-year-old man presents to the eye OPD with severe pain in his eye for the last 3 days. He gives a history of phacoemulsification and IOL implantation 5 days ago. On examination, his eye has a visual acuity of 6/60 with eyelid swelling, conjunctival congestion and chemosis. The cornea has a fibrous exudate and hypopyon. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Post-operative endophthalmitis

Explanation:
This is a classic presentation of acute post-operative endophthalmitis: recent surgery followed by severe pain, vision loss, eyelid swelling, intense inflammation (chemosis, exudate), and hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber).

================================================================================
Question 546 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#114. A 50-year-old presents with dimness of vision in the right eye for a long time. On examination, his visual acuity is 6/36 in the right eye, and there is a right RAPD. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable. The right fundus shows optic atrophy, cupping of the disc, and a significant visual field defect. What is the most appropriate next step of investigation in this patient?

Options:
  Neuroimaging (CT/MRI)

Explanation:
The patient has signs of unilateral optic neuropathy (decreased vision, RAPD, optic atrophy) that does not appear to be glaucomatous (as glaucoma is typically bilateral). It is crucial to rule out a compressive lesion affecting the anterior visual pathway (optic nerve, chiasm). Neuroimaging, specifically an MRI of the brain and orbits, is mandatory.

================================================================================
Question 547 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#115. An 80-year-old Caucasian smoker woman complains of recent problems with reading vision, specifically words appearing distorted and blank patches being present. Her vision is often good in brighter light. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/36 both eyes with no further improvement with refraction. Fundus shows numerous intermediate-size soft drusen in both eyes with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). How will you manage?

Options:
✓ Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections

Explanation:
The patient has wet (neovascular) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), as evidenced by the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The standard of care and first-line treatment for wet AMD is intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) agents, such as ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept.

================================================================================
Question 548 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#116. An 80-year-old Caucasian smoker woman complains of recent problems with reading vision, specifically words appearing distorted and blank patches being present. Her vision is often good in brighter light. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/36 both eyes with no further improvement with refraction. Pupils are reactive to light. Fundus shows numerous intermediate-size soft drusen in both eyes with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). How will you manage?

Options:
✓ Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections

Explanation:
This is a duplicate question. The patient has wet (neovascular) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), as evidenced by choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The standard of care is intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy to inhibit the growth of abnormal blood vessels and reduce leakage.

================================================================================
Question 549 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#117. A 60-year-old man presented to eye OPD with transient visual loss in the left eye that lasts for a few minutes. These episodes occur several times a day. Ocular examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial investigation?

Options:
  Carotid Doppler Ultrasound

Explanation:
The patient is describing amaurosis fugax, a transient monocular vision loss often described as a 'curtain coming down'. This is most commonly caused by an embolus from an atherosclerotic plaque in the ipsilateral carotid artery. A Carotid Doppler ultrasound is the most appropriate initial investigation to assess for carotid artery stenosis.

================================================================================
Question 550 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#118. A 45-year-old laborer presented to your clinic with a complaint of watering and irritation, more frequently during sun exposure. On slit-lamp examination, you observe a wedge-shaped growth of the conjunctiva that extends onto the nasal cornea. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
  Pterygium

Explanation:
A pterygium is a fibrovascular, wing-shaped growth of the conjunctiva that encroaches onto the cornea. It is strongly associated with chronic UV light exposure, as seen in laborers who work outdoors. A pinguecula is similar but does not cross onto the cornea.

================================================================================
Question 551 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#119. A 60-year-old male presented with sudden painless loss of vision in his right eye. On fundus examination, there were flame-shaped hemorrhages in all quadrants, dilated tortuous vessels, and a swollen optic disc, consistent with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion. Which complication will you expect in this patient 3 months after the event?

Options:
✓ Neovascular glaucoma
  Angle closure glaucoma
  Open angle glaucoma

Explanation:
The signs describe ischemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). A major complication of ischemic CRVO is severe retinal ischemia which triggers the release of VEGF, leading to rubeosis iridis (new vessels on the iris) and subsequent neovascular glaucoma. This typically develops around 90 days (3 months) after the initial event.

================================================================================
Question 552 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Q#120. A 4-year-old girl has convergent squint of the left eye. On examination, the eye is enlarged in size. What is the most likely underlying cause of this presentation?

Options:
  Congenital glaucoma

Explanation:
The question appears to be malformed. However, interpreting the key signs: in a young child, an enlarged eye (buphthalmos) combined with a squint is highly suggestive of congenital glaucoma. The high intraocular pressure causes the globe to stretch and enlarge, which can also disrupt vision and lead to a secondary strabismus (squint).

================================================================================
Question 553 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old male patient is coming to specialist outpatient complaining of difficulty in swallowing for liquids and solids, regurgitation of food and occasionally chest pain for the last 2 years. He has history of hospitalization for chest infection 9 months back. Examination of the neck is unremarkable and indirect laryngoscopy shows pooling of saliva. Low molecular weight barium swallow shows classical bird beak appearance. What is the most effective treatment for this disease?

Options:
  Botulinum toxin injection
✓ Cardiomyotomy with partial fundoplication
  Cardiomyotomy with complete fundoplication
  Oesophageal dilatation
  Oesophegectomy

Explanation:
The progressive dysphagia for both liquids and solids, regurgitation, pooling of saliva, and the classic 'bird beak appearance' on barium swallow are diagnostic of achalasia cardia. Cardiomyotomy (Heller myotomy) with partial fundoplication is the most effective surgical treatment, reducing lower esophageal sphincter pressure while preventing significant reflux.

================================================================================
Question 554 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old male patient is scheduled for nasal surgery for Ethmoidal polypi. Endoscopic examination shows no landmarks which suggest previous surgery. Further examination shows mucopus and fungal debris. CT Scan also shows heterogeneous opacities in all sinuses. What is the first surgical step in this case?

Options:
✓ a. Antrostomy
  b. Inferior Turbinectomy
  c. Middle Turbinectomy
  d. Polypectomy
  e. Uncinectomy

Explanation:
In revision FESS where landmarks (like the uncinate process) are absent or distorted, identifying the maxillary sinus ostium (Antrostomy) or the orbit is a key initial step for orientation.

================================================================================
Question 555 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old male patient is coming to specialist outpatient complaining of difficulty in swallowing for liquids and solids, regurgitation of food, and occasionally chest pain for the last 2 years. He has a history of hospitalization for chest infection 9 months back. Examination of the neck is unremarkable, and indirect laryngoscopy shows pooling of saliva. Low molecular weight barium swallow shows classical bird beak appearance. What is the most effective treatment for this disease?

Options:
  a. Botulinum toxin injection
✓ b. Cardiomyotomy with partial fundoplication
  c. Cardiomyotomy with complete fundoplication
  d. Oesophageal dilatation
  e. Oesophagectomy

Explanation:
Achalasia (Bird beak sign) is best treated surgically by Heller's Cardiomyotomy combined with a partial fundoplication (to prevent reflux).

================================================================================
Question 556 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 years old lady has an ulcerated nodular mass on her right medial lower eyelid for the last 4 years. The central ulceration has raised rolled edges with dilated blood vessels over the lateral margins.Preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes are not palpable. The most likely diagnosis is

Options:
✓ Basal Cell Carcinoma
  Kaposi Sarcoma
  Merkle Cell Tumor
  Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma
  Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Explanation:
The clinical features of an elderly patient presenting with a long-standing (4 years), slowly growing, ulcerated nodular mass on the medial lower eyelid, characterized by raised rolled edges and telangiectatic vessels (dilated blood vessels), are highly suggestive of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The absence of palpable regional lymph nodes is consistent with BCC, which rarely metastasizes.

================================================================================
Question 557 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years girl presents to EYE-OPD with a gradual painless swelling in the left lower eyelid for the last two months Palpation of the mass indicates a small nodule in the substance of the eyelid not involving the lid margin. The overlying skin is normal and mobile and eversion of the eyelid shows a mass in the tarsal plate. The girl is a known patient of blepharitis. The most probable diagnosis is:

Options:
  Basal cell carcinoma
✓ Chalazion
  Hordeolum Externum - (Stye.
  Hordeolum Internum
  Squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation:
A gradual, painless, localized swelling within the eyelid, palpable as a nodule in the tarsal plate, with normal and mobile overlying skin, and often associated with a history of blepharitis, is the classic description of a chalazion. It is a chronic lipogranulomatous inflammation of a meibomian gland.

================================================================================
Question 558 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 year old boy present to the casualty with severe pain in the right eye for the last two hours. On examination the right lower eyelid is red and swollen with severe tenderness. The lower eyelid margin is normal. On eversion of the eyelid there is appearance of pus shining through the conjunctiva. The probable diagnosis is: OPTION LIST

Options:
  Basal cell carcinoma
  Chalazion
  Hordeolum Externum - (Stye.
✓ Hordeolum Internum
  Squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation:
A hordeolum internum (internal stye) is an acute suppurative inflammation of a meibomian gland within the tarsal plate. It typically presents with severe pain, redness, swelling, and tenderness of the eyelid, and often shows pus pointing or shining through the conjunctiva on eversion of the eyelid.

================================================================================
Question 559 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32 years old female patient presents to eye OPD with complaints of drooping of the eyelids since last 1 year. She has complaints of increased fatigability. The ptosis is more during the evening and relatively less when she wakes up in the morning. Her ice-pack test is also positive. What is the most likely diagnosis in her case?

Options:
  Ptosis due to traumatic disinsertion of levator muscle
  Ptosis due to oculomotor (3rd nerve. palsy
✓ Ptosis due to Myasthenia gravis
  Ptosis due to Horner's syndrome
  Ptosis due to orbicularis overaction

Explanation:
The characteristic features of fluctuating ptosis that worsens with fatigue (more in the evening, less in the morning) and is associated with increased fatigability, along with a positive ice-pack test (temporary improvement in ptosis with cold application), are highly diagnostic of ptosis due to myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction.

================================================================================
Question 560 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old man present to EYE-OPD with irritation and foreign body sensation in the left eye for the last one month. On examination the left lower eyelid margin is turned towards the eyeball. The overlying skin is normal. On eversion of the eyelid the lid margin comes to its normal position but inverts again on forceful closure of the eyelid. The most probable diagnosis is:

Options:
  Acute spastic Entropion
  Cicatricial Entropion
  Congenital Entropion
  Epiblepharon,
✓ Involutional Entropion

Explanation:
In an elderly patient, inward turning of the lower eyelid margin (entropion) due to age-related changes, with normal overlying skin and the ability to temporarily correct the lid position on eversion but recurrence on forceful closure (due to preseptal orbicularis override), is characteristic of involutional (senile) entropion.

================================================================================
Question 561 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Drooping of upper eyelid absence of eyelid crease since birth occurs in:

Options:
  Congenital entropion
✓ Simple congenital ptosis
  Horner syndrome
  Congenital 3rdnerve palsy
  Congenital ectropion.

Explanation:
Simple congenital ptosis is characterized by the drooping of the upper eyelid present since birth, often associated with poor levator palpebrae superioris muscle function and an absent or poorly formed upper eyelid crease. This is a common form of congenital ptosis.

================================================================================
Question 562 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old patient presents to eye OPD with complaints of sudden onset of painful swelling near the medial canthus area. The swelling is tender to touch and red. The patient had previously watering from the eye. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Chronic Dacrocystitis
✓ Acute on chronic dacrocystitis
  Lacrimal gland tumor
  Stye
  Chalazion

Explanation:
The presentation of sudden onset painful, tender, and red swelling near the medial canthus, especially with a history of previous watering (epiphora, suggesting chronic obstruction), is highly indicative of an acute exacerbation of chronic dacryocystitis, often termed 'acute on chronic dacryocystitis'.

================================================================================
Question 563 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A mother has brought her 8 years old son to eye OPD for concerns of redness of eyes and itching. According to the mother, her son frequently rubs his eyes and is unable to go out in the sun due to photophobia. The condition is there since last 4 years. It is typically worse in spring and summers. On examination the patient has cobble-stone papillae on his tarsal conjunctiva. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Bacterial Conjunctivitis
✓ Vernal Kerato-conjunctivitis
  Congenital Naso-lacrimal duct obstruction
  Viral Conjunctivitis
  Corneal Ulcer

Explanation:
The clinical picture of a young boy with chronic, seasonal (spring/summer) itching, redness, photophobia, and the pathognomonic finding of 'cobble-stone' papillae (giant papillae) on the tarsal conjunctiva is classic for Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC).

================================================================================
Question 564 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 14 yrs old boy, who is a known patient of allergic conjunctivitis, presents to eye OPD complaining of painless, progressive dimness of vision. On examination the boy has progressive myopia and astigmatism. Distant direct ophthalmoscopy shows oil droplet reflex. There is bulging of the lower eyelid when the patient looks down.

Question 571 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 yrs old lady has developed loss of vision and pain in her right eye. On examination the patient has advanced diabetic eye disease, new vessels over the iris and angle of the anterior chamber with adhesion formation. The intraocular pressure is 50mmg. This type of glaucoma is called

Options:
  Pigmentary glaucoma
  Inflammatory giaucoma
✓ Neovascular glaucoma
  Phacomorphic glaucoma
  Pseudoexfoliation

Explanation:
Glaucoma caused by the growth of new vessels (neovascularization) in the angle, often secondary to ischemic conditions like diabetic retinopathy, is Neovascular Glaucoma.

================================================================================
Question 572 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A baby aged one month is brought to eye clinic with findings of haziness and larger corneal size noted on both sides. What do you think is the probable diagnosis in this infant?

Options:
  Congenital cataracts
✓ Congenital glaucoma (buphthalmos)
  Congenital rubella infection
  Megalocomea
  Birth trauma to cornea

Explanation:
Corneal haze and enlargement (buphthalmos) in an infant are key signs of Congenital Glaucoma.

================================================================================
Question 573 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
58 yr old lady having cataracts in both eyes presents to eye emergency department with the complaint of sudden onset of pain and gross dimness of vision in her right eye.

Options:
  Pigmentary glaucoma
  Inflammatory glaucoma
  Neovascular glaucoma
✓ Phacomorphic glaucoma
  Psudoexfoliation glaucoma

Explanation:
Phacomorphic glaucoma is a secondary angle-closure glaucoma caused by an intumescent (swollen) cataract pushing the iris forward and closing the angle. The presence of a 'dense cataract' (likely intumescent) causing a shallow chamber and high IOP fits this diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 574 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 yrs old man is suffering from right chronic anterior Uveitis for the last 3 months. On examination he has aqeous flare and cells in the right anterior chamber. He has 360 degrees posterior synechiae and intraocular pressure is 40mmHg. The man is suffering from

Options:
  Pigmentary glaucoma
✓ Inflammatory glaucoma
  Neovascular glaucoma
  Phacomorphic glaucoma
  Pseudoexfoliation

Question 576 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 years old gentleman who is otherwise fit presents to eye OPD with gradual progressive visual loss for last 2 years. His visual acuity were recorded as 6/24 both eyes and improved to 6/9 with pinhole. He was previously emmetropic but now his refractive error was -2.00 diopter. Pupillary responses and intraocular pressures are normal. 0m distant direct ophthalmoscopy there is media opacity which does not move with movement of the eye. The most likely diagnosis is :

Options:
  Asteroid hyalosis
  Corneal opacity
✓ Nuclear sclerosis cataract
  Posterior vitreous detachment
  Vitreous haemorhage

Explanation:
The myopic shift (-2.00 D in a previously emmetropic elderly patient) is classic for Nuclear Sclerosis. The media opacity being stationary (in the lens) rather than floating (vitreous) confirms cataract.

================================================================================
Question 577 (NWSM - 2023)

Question:
A 60 years old gentleman comes to you because he cannot see clearly for distance. His present reading glasses are 5 years old. He is otherwise fit. His visual acuity is 6/5 in both eyes corrected with glasses. His refractive error is -2.0 diopter sphere in both eyes. On examination his pupillary responses are normal. Anterior segment examination is normal with deep anterior chambers. His intraocular pressures were recorded as 28 and 30mmHg in the right and left eye respectively. His central corneal thickness is 515 microns in each eye. On fundoscopy he has got cupping of 0.6 in both eyes with nerve fibre layer haemorrhage along the superior border of the left optic disc. Visual field examination shows arcuate scotoma in both eyes. Most likely diagnosis is:

Options:
  Myopic degeneration of the retina
  Ocular hypertension
✓ Primary open angle glaucoma
  Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma
  Primary angle closure glaucoma

Explanation:
The patient has raised Intraocular Pressure (IOP > 21 mmHg), Glaucomatous Optic Nerve damage (Cupping 0.6, RNFL hemorrhage), and Visual Field defects (Arcuate scotoma). With deep anterior chambers, the angle is open. This confirms Primary Open Angle Glaucoma.

================================================================================
Question 617 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 years old male was involved in a road traffic accident 2 weeks back. He received trauma to left side of face and temporal bone. He had a concussion and was unconscious for 2 days which he spent in ICU. When he regained consciousness, the attending doctors noted asymmetry of his left side of face. The patient had a left facial palsy and even after 12 days, there was no improvement in his facial function. The test that would best indicate the chances of recovery of facial nerve at 2 weeks would be:

Options:
  Electromyography
✓ Electroneuronography
  Minimal nerve excitability test
  Maximal nerve stimulation test
  Tympanogram

Explanation:
Electroneuronography (ENoG) is the most valuable prognostic test for facial nerve paralysis when performed between 3 to 14 days post-injury (ideally around day 10-14). It quantifies the degeneration; >90% degeneration indicates a poor prognosis and may necessitate surgical decompression.

================================================================================
Question 619 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old male presented with complaints of left side nasal bleeding and pain from the last 6 months. O/E, patient had a fungating growth arising from left maxillary sinus and extending out in the nasal cavity. There were extensive erosions but no cervical Iymhadenopathy. The next step in management of this patient would be:

Options:
✓ Biopsy under local anaesthesia
  chemotherapy
  nasal endoscopy
  surgical resection
  wait and watch

Explanation:
A fungating mass with erosions is highly suspicious for malignancy (e.g., Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Maxillary sinus). A biopsy is required to confirm the histological diagnosis before planning definitive treatment (surgery/chemoradiation).

================================================================================
Question 620 (NWSM - 2025)

Options:
  Retinoblastoma
  Coat's disease
✓ Congenital cataracts
  Retinopathy of prematurity
  Toxocariasis

Explanation:
Bilateral leukocoria (white reflex) in an infant causing visual inattention is most commonly caused by Congenital Cataracts. While Retinoblastoma is a critical differential, cataracts are statistically more common causes of bilateral leukocoria in the absence of a visible mass description, and 'inattention to light' strongly suggests dense media opacity causing deprivation.

================================================================================
Question 622 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2-year-old boy is brought by his concerned parents to ophthalmology OPD for a white pupillary reflex in his right eye.

Question 677 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
When ciliary muscle contracts, it results into:

Options:
  Increase tension on zonular fibers
  Decrease tension on zonular fibers
  Decrease tension on the lens
✓ Both b and c

Explanation:
Contraction of the ciliary muscle moves the ciliary body inward/forward. This relaxes the zonular fibers (decreases tension), allowing the lens to become more spherical (increase curvature) for accommodation. So, it decreases tension on zonules and allows the lens capsule to mold the lens.
