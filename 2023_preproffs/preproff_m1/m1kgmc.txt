    "question": "A 20 year old male presented to ENT department with hearing loss in the left ear for the last 3 years. The hearing loss was progressive in nature and associated with tinnitus. During this period, the patient was falling to the left side while he was walking, a change in his voice and an inability to close the left eye with deviation of the angle of the mouth to the left side. Otologic examination showed no abnormality. Whats your likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [

    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Progressive unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, accompanied by cerebellar signs (falling to the left), lower cranial nerve involvement (voice change suggests vagus nerve), and facial nerve palsy (inability to close left eye, mouth deviation) are classic features of an acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma), a tumor growing on the vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) and often compressing adjacent cranial nerves."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Unilateral clear nasal discharge, especially increasing on bending forward and following head trauma, is highly suspicious for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. The most specific laboratory test to confirm CSF rhinorrhea is the detection of beta-2 transferrin (or beta-trace protein) in the nasal discharge, as these are uniquely found in CSF."

    "question": "An adult patient presented with a painful swelling at the tip of his nose and fever for two days. On examination, the nasal vestibule was erythematous and tender to touch. The condition was diagnosed as nasal furunculosis? Which one of the following pathogen is involved in this condition?",
    "options": [
      "a. streptococcus viridans",
      "b. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "c. Pneumococcus",
      "d. E coli.",
      "e. B proteus."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Nasal furunculosis (a painful boil or abscess in the nasal vestibule) is almost always caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*, which is a common commensal on the skin and in the anterior nares. The painful swelling, erythema, and tenderness are characteristic."

    "question": "A 30 years old male patient had recurrent attacks of pain in the right ear with blockage for 8 weeks. It was diagnosed as right chronic otitis externa. Which of the following organisms is responsible for this disease?",
    "options": [
      "a. Pseudomonas Aeruginosa",
      "b. Staph Aureus",
      "c. Morexella Cattarhalis",
      "d. Bacteriods",
      "e. H. Influenza"
    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a common causative organism for chronic otitis externa, especially in cases that are recurrent or associated with moisture/swimming. *Staphylococcus aureus* is also frequent, but *Pseudomonas* is a very typical cause of chronic/recalcitrant OE."

    "question": "A 25-year-old female patient presented with bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. On otoscopic examination, there was a reddish blush or sun rising appearance on the promontory, and on a pure tone audiogram, there was bilateral mild conductive hearing loss with a dip at the 2000 Hz frequency. What is your most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "a. Otitis media with effusion",
      "b. Otitis media",
      "c. Cholesterol granuloma",
      "d. Otosclerosis",
      "e. Meniere's disease"
    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss, an intact tympanic membrane, and the classic 'reddish blush' or 'sunrise appearance' (Schwartze's sign) on the promontory are pathognomonic for otosclerosis. The dip at 2000 Hz (Carhart's notch) is also characteristic of otosclerosis, reflecting a bone conduction artifact."

      "b. Lipoma",

      "e. pleomorphic adenoma"
    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "A slowly growing, non-tender, mobile, firm swelling in front of the ear (parotid region), without facial nerve involvement, is the classic presentation of a pleomorphic adenoma, which is the most common benign tumor of the parotid gland."
