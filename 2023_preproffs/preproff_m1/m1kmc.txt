    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The long history of foul-smelling ear discharge and decreased hearing, along with the presence of cholesteatoma (pearl-white material in the attic region) and mastoid opacity on CT, are classic signs of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) with cholesteatoma."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The description of an extracranial complication of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) presenting as a swelling and pain along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, with bone erosion in the mastoid, is characteristic of a Bezold's abscess.

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "For laryngeal carcinoma, vocal cord fixation places the tumor at least at T3. Involvement of the thyroid cartilage or extension beyond the larynx classifies it as T4. T4b indicates invasion of the prevertebral space, encasement of the carotid artery, or invasion of mediastinal structures, signifying very advanced disease. Given the comprehensive involvement described, T4b is the most appropriate classification among the options, signifying extensive disease."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The clinical picture describes acute otitis media (AOM) in a child.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "After removal of an airway foreign body, if the patient develops desaturation and hyperresonance on the chest, it raises concern for residual foreign body, airway edema causing persistent obstruction, or a complication like a pneumothorax (though hyperresonance usually suggests air trapping). Re-bronchoscopy would be the next step to re-evaluate the airway for any missed fragments, assess mucosal swelling, or rule out a post-extraction complication that might be causing ongoing obstruction/air trapping."

    "question": "A 40 year old lady is coming to specialist clinic complaining of difficulty in swallowing for the last 2 years. She has history of total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma 3 years back. Her Barium swallow is normal and flexible endoscopy shows right vocal cord paralysis. What is the most likely cause of dysphagia in this case?",
    "options": [
      "A. Decreased pharyngeal gradient pressure and decreased glottis closure",
      "B. Decreased pharyngeal gradient pressure and increased glottis closure",
      "C. Increased pharyngeal gradient pressure and increased glottis closure",
      "D. Increased pharyngeal gradient pressure and decreased glottis closure",
      "E. Superior constrictor muscle and cricothyroid muscle dysfunction"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Unilateral vocal cord paralysis (a potential complication of thyroidectomy due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury) primarily causes dysphagia by impairing glottic closure. This leads to inefficient protection of the airway during swallowing, causing aspiration and difficulty in bolus transport. While the exact phrasing of 'decreased pharyngeal gradient pressure' might be debated, the 'decreased glottis closure' is a direct and significant cause of dysphagia in this context."

    "explanation": "The 'worst headache of his life' with meningeal signs (neck pain, vomiting) is a red flag for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which primarily requires an unenhanced CT brain. However, the co-existing nasal obstruction, post-nasal drip, and mucopus suggest sinusitis, which can lead to intracranial complications (e.g., meningitis, abscess). A CT scan of the brain with contrast, combined with a CT of the paranasal sinuses, would provide a comprehensive evaluation for both potential causes of severe headache and any associated complications."

    "question": "A 39 year old lady presented to the Emergency room with profuse epistaxis for 4 hours. He has similar episodes in the past. Anterior nasal packing was done in emergency room but bleeding was uncontrolled. All baseline investigations were normal. The consultant decided to control the bleeding under General Anesthesia. What is the most likely vessel that needs to be clipped with Functional Endoscope in this case?",
    "options": [
      "A. Anterior Ethi midal",
      "B. Spenopalati neartery",
      "C. Posterior Ethi midal",
      "D. Greater palati neartery",
      "E. Septal artery"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Profuse epistaxis refractory to anterior nasal packing typically indicates a posterior bleed. The sphenopalatine artery (often misspelled in options as Spenopalatine artery) is the primary arterial supply to the posterior nasal cavity and is the most common target for endoscopic ligation to control severe posterior epistaxis."

    "question": "A middle age lady presented to outpatients department with complaints of nasal obstruction, headache and postnasal discharge for the last 9 months. Clinical examination, shows unilateral polyp, mucopus and mucin, CT scan shows double density opacity in the nose, Maxillary and Ethmoid region pushing the orbit on same side. What is the most appropriate treatment option in this case?",
    "options": [
      "A. Endoscopic sinus surgery",
      "B. Endoscopic sinus surgery plus topical nasal steroi ds.",
      "C. Endoscopic sinus surgery plus topical and oral steroi ds",
      "D. IV Amphoteracine B",
      "E. Topical nasal steroi ds"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The constellation of chronic unilateral nasal obstruction, headache, mucopus/mucin, unilateral polyp, and the classic 'double-density opacity' on CT (indicating fungal concretions within allergic mucin) that is pushing the orbit, is diagnostic of Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFS). The most appropriate treatment for AFS involves endoscopic sinus surgery for debridement, followed by a prolonged course of topical and oral corticosteroids to manage the allergic inflammation and prevent recurrence."

    "question": "A 20-year-old patient presented to ENT outpatient with the complaint of ear discharge for the last 6 years. The discharge is relieved by topical and systemic antibiotics, and aggravated by water entry. On clinical examination, he is diagnosed with Cholesteatoma right ear. What is the most likely preoperative investigation to help in management plan?",
    "options": [
      "A. CT scan with IV contrast",
      "B. CT Scan axial and coronal cuts",
      "C. CT scan Sagittal view",
      "D. MRI With IV contrast",
      "E. PET Scan"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "For a diagnosed cholesteatoma, a high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone with axial and coronal cuts is the standard and most crucial preoperative imaging investigation. It provides detailed information about the extent of the cholesteatoma, ossicular erosion, and involvement of surrounding structures, which is essential for surgical planning."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The 'double-density opacity' on CT scan, along with chronic unilateral nasal obstruction, headache, mucopus, mucin, and an expansile lesion pushing the orbit, is a classic presentation of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFS). This radiological sign represents fungal concretions within allergic mucin."

    "question": "A 27 year old patient is complaining of nasal obstruction for the last 7 months that is persistent and progressive and associated with headache. He has no history of any nasal surgery. On examination, there is mucopus in both nostrils, with postnasal drip with multiple large white-grayish senseless swellings in the nose. CT Scan without contrast shows heterogeneously opacities in nose and sinuses. What is the most appropriate treatment?",
    "options": [
      "A. Anti bioti cs first line",
      "B. FESS",
      "C. Intranasal polypectomy",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The chronic bilateral nasal obstruction, mucopus, postnasal drip, and multiple large polyps (white-grayish senseless swellings) in the nose, confirmed by heterogeneous opacities on CT, are indicative of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is the most appropriate and definitive surgical treatment for such cases, often combined with medical therapy."

    "options": [

      "E. Tympanometry"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Given the symptoms of mouth breathing, snoring, and bilateral decreased hearing in a child with enlarged adenoids, otitis media with effusion (OME) is highly suspected. To confirm the diagnosis and characterize the hearing loss, both Pure Tone Audiometry (to assess the degree of hearing loss) and Tympanometry (to assess middle ear function and confirm the presence of effusion) are the most crucial and complementary investigations."
