    "question": "A 38-year-old gentleman reports of decreased hearing in the right ear for the last 2 years. On testing with a 512-Hz tuning fork, the Rinne's test (without masking) is negative on the right ear and positive on the left ear. With the Weber's test the tone is perceived louder in the left ear. The patient most likely has?",
    "options": [
      "a) Right conductive hearing loss",
      "b) Right sensorineural hearing loss",
      "c) Left sensorineural hearing loss",
      "d) Left conductive hearing loss",
      "e) left ear profound hearing loss"
    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "This scenario describes a 'false negative' Rinne test on the right. A negative Rinne usually means conductive loss (BC > AC), but if Weber lateralizes to the *opposite* (better) ear (left in this case), it suggests a profound sensorineural hearing loss (dead ear) on the right. The patient hears the bone conduction on the right side via the left cochlea (cross-hearing). Thus, this is a case of right-sided profound sensorineural hearing loss (or a 'dead ear'). Note: The options might be tricky. E says 'left ear profound...', but the description fits a right dead ear. However, if we reinterpret: Rinne negative Right (BC>AC), Positive Left (AC>BC). Weber to Left. This is classic for Right Severe SNHL (False Negative Rinne). But if the options don't list Right Severe SNHL, let's re-evaluate. If it were Right Conductive, Weber would go to the Right. It goes to Left. So it's Right SNHL. Option B is Right SNHL. But profound loss creates the false negative Rinne. Let's assume standard interpretation: Weber to better ear = SNHL in worse ear. Rinne false negative confirms severe/profound loss. So B or E (if E said right). Assuming typo in E or B is intended."
