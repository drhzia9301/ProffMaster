    "question": "A 15-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room after suffering a tonic- clonic seizure 4 weeks after a bite by a rabid bat. The boy appears irritable and agitated, and his parents state that he has difficulty swallowing fluids. Lumbar puncture shows numerous lymphocytes. The patient becomes delirious, slips into a coma, and expires. At autopsy, the brain stem shows infilltrates of lymphocytes around small blood vessels and evidence of neuronophagia. Some neurons contain cosinophilic inclusions. What is the proper name for these neuronal inclusions?",
    "options": [
      "a. Councilman bodies",
      "b. Hirano bodies",
      "c. Lewy bodies",

    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a seizure following a rabid bat bite, along with dysphagia, agitation, and delirium, is characteristic of rabies. The pathognomonic histological finding in rabies is the presence of eosinophilic neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, known as Negri bodies, typically found in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, as well as brain stem neurons."

Physical examination reveal involuntary jerky movements and poor concentration. When an MRI Brain demonstrates atrophy of caudate nucleus and putamen as well as dilatation of ventricles, you fear that patient will likely succumb to dementia as his mother. What is the likely diagnosis:",

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The CSF findings of increased pressure, neutrophilic pleocytosis (increased neutrophils), and decreased glucose, along with clinical signs of high fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia, are most characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. However, since 'Bacterial meningitis' is not an option, fungal meningitis can sometimes present with decreased glucose and increased neutrophils, especially in early or acute phases, though lymphocytic predominance is more typical. Therefore, from the given options, fungal meningitis is the most plausible infectious etiology that can have decreased CSF glucose."

    "question": "A 27 years old man comes to the OPD with complaints of numbness and tingling in his fingers and tops. The patient had been taking a drug for one month to abort migraine headaches. Which one of the following drugs most likely caused the symptoms in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "a. Amitriptyline.",
      "b. Fluoxetine",
      "c. Mirtazepine",
      "d. Trazodone",
      "e. Venlafaxine"
    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Among the listed options, Amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) is sometimes used for migraine prophylaxis, but it is not typically taken to *abort* migraine headaches. However, none of the other antidepressant options are primarily used for acute migraine abortion. If this question implies a medication used for migraine, and also caused peripheral neuropathy symptoms (numbness, tingling), it's a bit tricky. Ergotamine derivatives (not listed) are classic for causing peripheral vascular symptoms, but Amitriptyline can have various side effects. This question seems to have a slight mismatch or expects a less common association. Re-evaluating, the options are all antidepressants. Amitriptyline is not a drug to abort migraines. This question might be flawed in its premise or options regarding 'abort migraine headaches'. Assuming it meant for *prophylaxis*, none of these directly cause numbness and tingling in a way that stands out as a unique side effect leading to this specific question, compared to other migraine medications. If the question implies a common adverse effect, TCAs can sometimes cause paresthesias. However, without a clearer context on the drug to *abort* migraines, and given the options are all antidepressants, there may be a misinterpretation. Let's assume there's a typo in the original question and the drug was intended for migraine *prophylaxis* or the options are for a different question. However, if forced to choose an antidepressant that might cause paresthesias, it's difficult to pinpoint definitively. Let's reconsider. Maybe there's a misdirection. The question is "Which one of the following drugs most likely caused the symptoms in this patient?". None of the given antidepressants are typically used to "abort" migraine headaches. If the patient was taking an antidepressant for some other reason and then developed numbness/tingling, it could be a side effect. Amitriptyline, being a TCA, can have various neurological side effects including paresthesias. However, the scenario of "abort migraine headaches" is problematic. Given it's a pharmacology question, there might be a classic association. Let's assume the question intends to ask about a drug used for migraine that could cause these symptoms. But from the given options, all are antidepressants. It's possible the question is poorly phrased, and it's asking about an antidepressant that might cause these symptoms. Amitriptyline is a TCA, which can have anticholinergic side effects and other neurological effects.

Let's use an external search to confirm if any of these are commonly linked to numbness and tingling in the context of migraine treatment/prophylaxis.
Amitriptyline is used for migraine prophylaxis, and neuropathic pain, but paresthesia can be a side effect.
Fluoxetine (SSRI) can cause paresthesias, but less typically.
Mirtazapine (NaSSA) can cause paresthesias.
Trazodone (SARI) can cause paresthesias.
Venlafaxine (SNRI) can cause paresthesias.

Given the common uses, if it's for *prophylaxis* of migraine, Amitriptyline is a strong candidate among the given options for migraine use, and can cause paresthesias. The phrasing "abort migraine headaches" is still problematic. However, if it's a trick question and it was meant to be a drug for migraine prophylaxis, amitriptyline would be the best fit for both the condition and potential side effect, among the given antidepressant options.

Let's assume the question implicitly refers to a drug used for migraine prophylaxis that has a known side effect profile including paresthesias. Amitriptyline is a TCA often used for migraine prophylaxis, and paresthesias are a recognized side effect.
Therefore, "a. Amitriptyline" is the most plausible answer, despite the slight imprecision in "abort migraine headaches."```json

Fluphenazine and olanzapine are antipsychotics (some atypical antipsychotics might be used cautiously for Parkinson's psychosis, but typically not these), lithium is a mood stabilizer, and valproic acid is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. None of these are first-line treatments for Parkinson's motor symptoms. However, if the question implies 'not *any* use' related to Parkinson's, then fluphenazine and olanzapine (typical and atypical antipsychotics respectively) are often avoided or used with extreme caution in Parkinson's due to potential to worsen motor symptoms, but atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine are sometimes used for Parkinson's psychosis. Given the options, Carbamazepine, Lithium, and Valproic acid are primarily used for other neurological/psychiatric conditions and have no direct role in Parkinson's disease treatment.

    "explanation": "Propranolol (a non-selective beta-blocker) is often the first-line treatment for essential tremor. However, in a patient with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma, COPD), non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol are contraindicated due to the risk of bronchospasm. Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker (beta-1 selective) and is generally considered safer for essential tremor in patients with pulmonary disease as it has less effect on bronchial beta-2 receptors."

    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "The short duration of action of highly lipid-soluble drugs like diazepam (when given as a single IV dose for induction) is primarily due to rapid redistribution of the drug from the highly perfused central compartment (brain) to less perfused peripheral tissues (muscle, fat). Despite a long elimination half-life, the drug quickly leaves the brain, leading to a rapid cessation of its acute central effects."

    "options": [
      "a. Excessive take of Nacl increases the lithium toxicity",
      "b. Lithium allieviates the manic phase of bipolar disorder within 24 hrs",
      "c. It does not cross the placental barrier",
      "d. Its dosage must be decreased in patients taking thiazides",
      "e. Its elimination rate is equivalent to creatinine."
    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Thiazide diuretics reduce the renal clearance of lithium, leading to increased serum lithium levels and a higher risk of toxicity. Therefore, the lithium dosage must be decreased in patients taking thiazides. Excessive intake of NaCl decreases lithium toxicity (by increasing its excretion), and lithium's onset of action for mania is typically several days, not 24 hours. Lithium does cross the placental barrier, and its elimination is primarily renal but not exactly equivalent to creatinine clearance for dosage adjustment purposes."

The most appropriate and immediate course of action for Wernicke's encephalopathy is the administration of intravenous thiamine. While chlordiazepoxide (a benzodiazepine) is used to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms like delirium and agitation, it does not address the underlying thiamine deficiency.

    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "While managing kerosene poisoning primarily involves supportive care and preventing aspiration, some historical or regional practices might involve the administration of a liquid paraffin (mineral oil) orally. Liquid paraffin can act as a laxative and a demulcent, potentially binding to some unabsorbed kerosene and hastening its passage through the gut, thereby theoretically slowing down absorption or reducing contact time, though its efficacy and safety are debated and not universally recommended over other measures like activated charcoal (which is generally ineffective for hydrocarbons) or direct treatment of complications. Given the options, and the context of \"oral to slow down absorption,\" liquid paraffin is the intended answer despite modern guidelines often prioritizing other measures."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The fatal dose of kerosene is highly variable and depends on factors like age, route of exposure, and individual sensitivity. While aspiration of even a small amount (e.g., 1-2 ml) can cause severe pneumonitis, the lethal oral dose is generally considered to be above 10-30 mL in adults, though severe toxicity can occur at lower doses in children. Given the options, 'more than 10ml' is the most plausible for a fatal oral dose."

    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Strychnine acts as a competitive antagonist at glycine receptors, particularly in the spinal cord. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, especially at the anterior horn cells. By blocking glycine's inhibitory action, strychnine leads to uncontrolled excitation of motor neurons, resulting in exaggerated reflexes and severe muscle spasms."

    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Decreasing the cut-off point for a screening test means that more individuals will be classified as 'positive.' This action increases the test's sensitivity (correctly identifying those with the disease), leading to an increase in true positives and a decrease in false negatives. However, it also decreases the test's specificity (correctly identifying those without the disease), resulting in an increase in false positives (healthy individuals incorrectly identified as having the disease). Thus, both true positives and false positives will increase."

    "options": [
      "c. 20/0"
    ],
    "answer": "None of the above",
    "explanation": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a significant proportion of the global population is affected by mental or neurological disorders. The exact figures vary by specific disorder and lifetime prevalence versus point prevalence. However, the WHO often cites figures around 1 in 4 (25%) or 1 in 5 (20%) adults experiencing a mental health condition in a given year, and the lifetime prevalence is higher. The option '20/0' is likely a typo for 20%, but the question phrasing 'at some point of their lives' suggests lifetime prevalence, which is often higher than 20% for a broad category of mental or neurological disorders. Without a precise match for a common WHO statistic from the garbled option, a definitive answer from the provided list is difficult."

If 18 out of 20 people with liver carcinoma had chronic hepatitis, then 18/20 represents the proportion of cases among those with the disease that are attributable to that exposure. It is often expressed as (Incidence in exposed - Incidence in unexposed) / Incidence in exposed, or simply the proportion of cases with the exposure if the exposure is considered causative among cases.

    "explanation": "For a normally distributed sample, the probability that the population mean (μ) falls within a certain range can be estimated using the empirical rule if the range corresponds to standard deviations from the sample mean. If the sample mean is 20 and the standard deviation is 5, then a range of 10 to 30 represents two standard deviations on either side of the mean (20 ± 2*5 = 20 ± 10, i.e., 10 to 30). In a normal distribution, approximately 95% (specifically 95.4%) of values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "If the most common age (mode or peak of the distribution) for colorectal cancer is 58 years, and cancer incidence generally increases with age, it suggests that there would be more older individuals affected than younger ones. This kind of distribution, where the tail extends more towards the younger ages (left side) and the peak is towards the older ages, would be negatively skewed (or left-skewed). However, typically, diseases that increase with age would show a distribution where the mean is pulled towards higher ages, implying a *positively* skewed distribution (tail to the right). If 58 is the *mode*, and there are fewer cases at very high ages, it could be negatively skewed. But if it peaks at 58 and then declines, it's more likely to be positively skewed if the disease occurs at all ages but increasingly in older age. Let's reconsider. Cancer incidence *increases* with age. So the 'peak' might be later in life, and there would be a long 'tail' of older people. So the data would be skewed to the right (positively skewed). However, if the 'most common age' is interpreted as the average, and then there's a decline, it could be different. Given the typical age distribution of colorectal cancer, it usually increases with age. A distribution peaking at 58 and having a tail of older individuals would be positively skewed. If the question implies that the majority are around 58 and then drops sharply (fewer very old patients), it might be negatively skewed. Without more context, this is ambiguous. However, if 58 is the "most common age," it means the *mode* is 58. Diseases that occur more frequently in older age tend to have a distribution that is *positively skewed* (tail extending to the right, towards higher ages). This is because the incidence keeps rising with age, leading to a longer right tail. Therefore, 'Positively skewed' is the most likely shape for a disease like colorectal cancer, where risk increases with age."

The question 'Her observations are recorded as' and then listed observations means it is a statement, not a query seeking a diagnosis or interpretation from the list itself. The actual question seems to be 'What is the next step in your management plan for this patient?', which follows. Therefore, 'None of the above' is the answer to the incomplete query of 'Her observations are recorded as.'"

    "explanation": "A sudden onset, severe, diffuse headache (often described as 'thunderclap' headache) with vomiting, especially in a previously healthy young woman, is a red flag for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The first and most crucial diagnostic step is an urgent non-contrast CT head to rule out SAH or other intracranial pathology. Oral sumatriptan is for migraine, oxygen for cluster headache, and LP/antibiotics are considered after CT (if SAH is ruled out and meningitis is suspected)."

In such severe drug-induced agitation and delirium, which can lead to hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis, immediate management focuses on supportive care, including ventilator support if respiratory compromise occurs, and controlling agitation/seizures. Benzodiazepines are typically first-line for agitation and seizures, and antipsychotics like haloperidol can be used for severe agitation or psychosis that doesn't respond to benzodiazepines.

    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The sudden onset of right-sided weakness (hemiparesis/hemiplegia) in an elderly patient with atrial fibrillation (a strong risk factor for cardioembolic stroke) and who recently stopped warfarin (increasing stroke risk) is highly indicative of an ischemic stroke. A CT scan showing no intracranial bleed is consistent with an acute ischemic stroke (which may not be immediately visible on CT) rather than a hemorrhagic one."
