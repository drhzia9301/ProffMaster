    "question": "A 70 year old man presented with the complaint of difficulty to recognize the faces. Fundus examination shows some disturbance in the macular area. Which one is the most appropriate test for the diagnosis of his disease?",
    "options": [
      "a. B-Scan ultrasound",

      "c. Optical coherence tomography",
      "d. Color vision test",
      "e. Visual acuity"
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Difficulty recognizing faces (prosopagnosia) can be related to central visual processing issues, and given the fundus examination showing macular disturbance, conditions affecting the macula are suspected. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of the macula, making it the most appropriate test for detailed diagnosis of various retinal and macular diseases that could affect central vision."

    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "In a patient with a mature cataract where the view of the retina is obscured, B-scan ultrasonography (U/S) is the standard and first-line investigation. It allows for the visualization and assessment of the retina and vitreous to rule out any posterior segment pathology, such as retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage, before proceeding with cataract surgery."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula is primarily used for conditions affecting the macula and retina, such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration, Cystoid Macular Edema, Epi Retinal Membrane, and Macular Hole. Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy that primarily affects the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer, for which OCT of the optic nerve head and RNFL is used, not specifically OCT of the macula for primary diagnosis."

In such cases, a permanent brow suspension (frontalis suspension) procedure is often performed to connect the eyelid to the frontalis muscle, allowing the child to lift the eyelid by raising their eyebrow.

In cases of unilateral ptosis, the brain compensates by sending increased innervation to both levators. When the ptotic lid is surgically corrected or manually lifted, this compensatory excess innervation to the contralateral levator is unmasked, causing the contralateral (previously normal) eyelid to drop."

Lateral lid laxity, however, is a factor that contributes more directly to ectropion (outward rolling) by allowing the lid to sag laterally, rather than rolling inward."

Dacryocystectomy (removal of the lacrimal sac) is an alternative surgical treatment, particularly for older patients or those unfit for DCR, although it results in persistent epiphora.

    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The lacrimal sac is anatomically located in the lacrimal fossa, which is situated below the medial palpebral ligament. Therefore, swelling associated with chronic dacryocystitis or a mucocele typically presents as a mass located below the medial palpebral ligament in the medial canthal area."

      "a. Spectacles",

      "c. Corneal cross linkage",
      "d. Eximer laser",
      "e. Penetrating keratoplasty"
    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "In 'advanced' keratoconus, where corneal scarring is present or the cone is too steep for contact lenses to fit or correct vision adequately, surgical intervention is required. Penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant) or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is the standard treatment for restoring vision in advanced cases. Cross-linking is for progression, not restoring vision in advanced cases. Spectacles and contacts often fail in advanced disease."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "For severe bacterial corneal ulcers (suggested by hypopyon), broad-spectrum coverage is essential. The standard 'duotherapy' often involves fortified antibiotics to cover both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. A common regimen is a fortified cephalosporin (e.g., cefazolin for Gram-positives) and a fortified aminoglycoside (e.g., tobramycin or gentamicin for Gram-negatives)."

Fungal keratitis typically has a drier, necrotic appearance with feathery margins. However, fungal is also a strong differential.

To prevent this, a surgical inferior peripheral iridectomy (Ando iridectomy) is performed at the 6 o'clock position to allow aqueous to pass into the anterior chamber even if the pupil is blocked by the buoyant oil."

Given the headache component and age, Hyperopia decompensating or early presbyopia are key. Since Presbyopia is strictly age-related loss of accommodation and Hyperopia is a refractive error causing similar near symptoms often earlier, Hyperopia fits well if she needs accommodation for distance too but hides it. However, the classic near-vision difficulty at 40 is Presbyopia."

    "options": [
      "a. Keep under observation until 2-years of age",
