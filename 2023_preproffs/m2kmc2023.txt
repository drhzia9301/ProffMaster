    "question": "A 30 years old man presents to Eye OPD with diplopia and bilateral droopy eyelids which worsen in the evening. There is also a history of fatigability. On examination, his visual acuity is 6/6 in both eyes. Anterior and posterior segment examination is unremarkable. There is bilateral ptosis partially obstructing the visual axis and 20 prism diopter esotropia. Which of the following tests would you perform next?",
    "options": [
      "a. Chest X-ray",
      "b. CT head",
      "c. Ice pack test",
      "d. MRI brain",
      "e. Serum antibodies"
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of fatigable weakness, specifically ptosis and diplopia that worsen as the day progresses, are classic for ocular Myasthenia Gravis. The ice pack test is a simple, quick, and specific bedside test for this condition. Applying ice to the droopy eyelid for 2-5 minutes can temporarily improve the ptosis in myasthenic patients, as cold improves neuromuscular transmission."

Her vision is often good in brighter light. On examination, her vision is 6/36 both eyes with no further improvement with refraction. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable. Pupils are reactive to light. Fundus shows numerous intermediate-size soft drusen in both eyes with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). How will you manage?",

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The diagnosis is wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), confirmed by the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The standard of care and first-line treatment for wet AMD is intravitreal injections of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (anti-VEGF) agents.

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Phacolytic glaucoma occurs when a hypermature cataract leaks soluble lens proteins through an intact lens capsule. These proteins are engulfed by macrophages, which then obstruct the trabecular meshwork, leading to acute open-angle glaucoma with very high IOP and inflammation. Phacomorphic glaucoma involves a swollen lens pushing the iris forward, causing angle closure."

      "d. Trachoma",
      "e. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis"
    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "The combination of seasonal (summer) recurrence, intense itching, and the classic signs of giant 'cobblestone' papillae on the upper tarsal conjunctiva and limbal inflammation are pathognomonic for Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), a severe form of allergic eye disease."

    "question": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to you with trauma by scissor when he was playing with it. On examination, you found that his cornea is perforated. What is your 1st step of management as a community doctor?",
    "options": [
      "a. Repairing of the cornea",
      "b. Refer the patient without doing anything",
      "c. Steroid ointment, then refer the patient",
      "d. Topical steroids then refer the patient",
      "e. Topical antibiotics, pad the eye then refer"
    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "In a case of an open globe injury (corneal perforation), the immediate priorities for a non-specialist are to prevent infection and protect the eye from further damage. This involves applying a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic, placing a protective shield (or a very gentle pad) over the eye without applying pressure, and arranging for immediate referral to an ophthalmologist for surgical repair."

    "question": "A 65-year-old patient presented with vertical diplopia for the last week. She has a history of road traffic accident 01 week ago. On examination, vision in both eyes is 6/6. There is hypertropia of right eye and the patient cannot depress the eye in adduction. Which nerve is most probably involved?",
    "options": [
      "a. Abducent nerve",
      "b. Nasociliary nerve",
      "c. Oculomotor nerve",
      "d. Optic nerve",
      "e. Trochlear nerve"
    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "The superior oblique muscle is responsible for depressing the eye when it is in the adducted (turned in) position. This muscle is innervated by the trochlear nerve (IVth cranial nerve). An inability to depress the adducted eye is the classic sign of a trochlear nerve palsy, which is common after head trauma due to the nerve's long intracranial course."

Her vision is often good in brighter light. On examination, her vision is 6/36 both eyes with no further improvement with refraction. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable. Pupils are reactive to light. Fundus shows numerous intermediate-size soft drusen in both eyes with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). How will you manage?",

      "a. Intravitreal antibiotics",
      "b. Intravitreal antiVEGF",
      "c. Multivitamins",

      "e. Subtenon triamcinolone"
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "This is a duplicate question. The diagnosis is wet AMD due to the presence of CNV. The standard of care is treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections to suppress the growth and leakage from the abnormal blood vessels."

      "e. Post-operative vitreous hemorrhage"
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The acute onset of severe pain, profound vision loss, and intense intraocular inflammation (indicated by a hypopyon) within days of an intraocular surgery like cataract extraction is the classic presentation of post-operative endophthalmitis, a severe infection inside the eye."
