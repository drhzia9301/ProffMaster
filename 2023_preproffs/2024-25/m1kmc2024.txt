    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "Generalized or focal arteriolar narrowing is one of the earliest signs of hypertensive retinopathy (Grade 1-2). Severe or malignant stage changes (Grade 4) are characterized by more advanced signs like flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and optic disc swelling (papilledema)."

    "explanation": "In gonioscopy, if only Schwalbe's line (the most anterior structure) is visible, it means all the functional parts of the angle (trabecular meshwork, scleral spur, ciliary body) are obscured by the peripheral iris. This corresponds to a Grade 0 or closed angle."

    "question": "Q#112. A 6-month-old infant is brought by parents with complaints of watering, redness, photophobia, and not fixing and following light with the right eye. On examination, he has nystagmus with an enlarged, hazy cornea. Fundus examination is not possible due to poor view. IOP is 30 in the right eye under sedation. What is your diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "c) Congenital glaucoma"
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The classic triad of epiphora (watering), photophobia, and blepharospasm, combined with the signs of an enlarged, hazy cornea (buphthalmos and corneal edema) and elevated IOP, is pathognomonic for congenital glaucoma."

    "question": "Q#113. A 50-year-old man presents to the eye OPD with severe pain in his eye for the last 3 days. He gives a history of phacoemulsification and IOL implantation 5 days ago. On examination, his eye has a visual acuity of 6/60 with eyelid swelling, conjunctival congestion and chemosis. The cornea has a fibrous exudate and hypopyon. What is the most probable diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "a) Post-operative endophthalmitis"
    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of acute post-operative endophthalmitis: recent surgery followed by severe pain, vision loss, eyelid swelling, intense inflammation (chemosis, exudate), and hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber)."

    "question": "Q#114. A 50-year-old presents with dimness of vision in the right eye for a long time. On examination, his visual acuity is 6/36 in the right eye, and there is a right RAPD. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable. The right fundus shows optic atrophy, cupping of the disc, and a significant visual field defect. What is the most appropriate next step of investigation in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "b) Neuroimaging (CT/MRI)"
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The patient has signs of unilateral optic neuropathy (decreased vision, RAPD, optic atrophy) that does not appear to be glaucomatous (as glaucoma is typically bilateral). It is crucial to rule out a compressive lesion affecting the anterior visual pathway (optic nerve, chiasm). Neuroimaging, specifically an MRI of the brain and orbits, is mandatory."

    "question": "Q#115. An 80-year-old Caucasian smoker woman complains of recent problems with reading vision, specifically words appearing distorted and blank patches being present. Her vision is often good in brighter light. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/36 both eyes with no further improvement with refraction. Fundus shows numerous intermediate-size soft drusen in both eyes with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). How will you manage?",
    "options": [
      "a) Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections"
    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The patient has wet (neovascular) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), as evidenced by the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The standard of care and first-line treatment for wet AMD is intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) agents, such as ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept."

Her vision is often good in brighter light. On examination, her visual acuity is 6/36 both eyes with no further improvement with refraction. Pupils are reactive to light.

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This is a duplicate question. The patient has wet (neovascular) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), as evidenced by choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The standard of care is intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy to inhibit the growth of abnormal blood vessels and reduce leakage."

    "options": [
      "e) Carotid Doppler Ultrasound"
    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "The patient is describing amaurosis fugax, a transient monocular vision loss often described as a 'curtain coming down'. This is most commonly caused by an embolus from an atherosclerotic plaque in the ipsilateral carotid artery. A Carotid Doppler ultrasound is the most appropriate initial investigation to assess for carotid artery stenosis."

    "options": [
      "e) Pterygium"
    ],
    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "A pterygium is a fibrovascular, wing-shaped growth of the conjunctiva that encroaches onto the cornea. It is strongly associated with chronic UV light exposure, as seen in laborers who work outdoors. A pinguecula is similar but does not cross onto the cornea."

    "question": "Q#119. A 60-year-old male presented with sudden painless loss of vision in his right eye. On fundus examination, there were flame-shaped hemorrhages in all quadrants, dilated tortuous vessels, and a swollen optic disc, consistent with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion. Which complication will you expect in this patient 3 months after the event?",
    "options": [
      "a) Neovascular glaucoma",
      "b) Angle closure glaucoma",
      "c) Open angle glaucoma"
    ],
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The signs describe ischemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). A major complication of ischemic CRVO is severe retinal ischemia which triggers the release of VEGF, leading to rubeosis iridis (new vessels on the iris) and subsequent neovascular glaucoma. This typically develops around 90 days (3 months) after the initial event."

    "question": "Q#120. A 4-year-old girl has convergent squint of the left eye. On examination, the eye is enlarged in size. What is the most likely underlying cause of this presentation?",
    "options": [
      "c) Congenital glaucoma"
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The question appears to be malformed. However, interpreting the key signs: in a young child, an enlarged eye (buphthalmos) combined with a squint is highly suggestive of congenital glaucoma. The high intraocular pressure causes the globe to stretch and enlarge, which can also disrupt vision and lead to a secondary strabismus (squint)."
