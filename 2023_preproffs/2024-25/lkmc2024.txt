    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "50% of 1680 kcal = 840 kcal. Fat provides 9 kcal/gram. Therefore, the amount of fat utilized is 840 kcal / 9 kcal/gm = 93.33 gm. The closest option is 93 gm."

She has no other significant history. On examination she had a vaginal vault prolapse that extended beyond the introitus and also had a vaginal wall tear. She is married and wishes to resume her marital relationship with her husband. What is the best option for treatment for this patient? Choose the single best answer.",

She wishes to maintain sexual function, so colpocleisis (closing the vagina) is contraindicated. A vaginal repair with sacrospinous fixation effectively addresses the vault prolapse while preserving vaginal depth and avoiding the risks of re-entering the abdomen."

The uterus size (6 weeks) being smaller than dates (3 months) could suggest some products have passed or growth arrested, but the open os with ongoing bleeding/pain is the key for inevitable (or incomplete if products are passing).

However, 'Conventional carcinoma' usually refers to Clear Cell RCC.
