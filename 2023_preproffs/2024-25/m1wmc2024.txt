      "c. Standing",
      "d. On one side."
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "After a tracheostomy, the patient is usually placed in a semi-sitting (Fowler's) position. This helps to reduce edema, facilitates drainage of secretions, improves ventilation, and minimizes the risk of aspiration."

      "c. Loosely tied tape.",
      "d. All of the above."
    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "A tracheostomy tube can slip or become displaced due to several factors: if the tube is too small for the stoma, if it is not secured tightly enough (loosely tied tape), or if a violent cough generates enough force to dislodge it. Therefore, all of the listed reasons are potential causes."

      "c. Aryepiglottic folds.",
      "d. All of the above."
    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The larynx has three levels of sphincteric protection to prevent aspiration: the aryepiglottic folds (supraglottic), the ventricular bands (false vocal cords), and the true vocal cords (glottis). All of these structures contribute to the sphincteric function of the larynx."

      "c. Wash out of the blood carbon dioxide level",
      "d. None of the above."
    ],
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "In patients with chronic upper airway obstruction, the respiratory drive is often maintained by hypoxic drive or high CO2 levels. When the trachea is opened (tracheostomy), the obstruction is suddenly relieved, leading to a rapid washout of accumulated CO2. This sudden drop in PaCO2 removes the primary respiratory stimulus, causing temporary apnea (apnea of relief)."

It is a chronic granulomatous disease that affects the respiratory tract, progressing from the nose to the larynx."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Referred otalgia (ear pain) from the tonsil or tonsillar fossa is mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). The tympanic branch of CN IX (Jacobson's nerve) supplies sensation to the middle ear, and the tonsillar branch supplies the tonsil."

    ],

    ],
    "answer": "d",

      "c. To detect bleeding.",
      "d. All of the above."
    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The tonsil position (lateral position with head down and slight extension) serves multiple purposes: it keeps the airway open by preventing the tongue from falling back, allows blood and secretions to drain out of the mouth (preventing aspiration/inhalation), and makes active bleeding easier to detect as it trickles out."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "In a 13-year-old boy, unilateral nasal obstruction and discharge should raise suspicion for a foreign body (less likely at this age), antrochoanal polyp, or nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (associated with epistaxis). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is possible but rare. Choanal atresia presents in infancy. Adenoids are usually bilateral. The *most* probable diagnosis for this specific demographic and presentation isn't perfectly captured by the specific options A-C, though antrochoanal polyp (not listed) is a strong candidate. Among the choices, none is a classic fit for 'most probable' compared to common entities like a polyp or deviated septum/sinusitis. However, if forced to choose pathology, angiofibroma (also not listed) is a key differential. Given options, 'None of them' is a reasonable choice if common causes like polyps are absent."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The fluid in secretory otitis media (otitis media with effusion) is typically a sterile transudate (serous) or exudate (mucoid) resulting from negative pressure and inflammation, but 'transudate' or 'serous/mucoid' are classic descriptions distinguishing it from purulent infection. In early stages, it's often a transudate due to vacuum effect."
