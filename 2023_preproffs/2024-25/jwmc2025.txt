    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Relative Risk (RR) = (Incidence in exposed) / (Incidence in unexposed). If a food is not a source of poisoning, the risk of getting sick is the same whether you ate it or not. The RR would be 1.0. However, if it's protective or associated with *fewer* cases, the RR would be less than 1. Since RR of 1 is not an option and the conclusion is *not* a source, an RR slightly above 1 (1.1) would indicate no strong association, but 0.5 implies a protective effect. If we interpret 'not a source' as having no positive association, then RR would be ≤ 1. The question is a bit ambiguous, as RR=1.1 is also a very weak association. Let's assume 'not a source' implies no link at all (RR=1) or a protective link (RR<1). 0.5 is the only option < 1."
