    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Conn's syndrome (Primary Hyperaldosteronism) is characterized by the autonomous secretion of aldosterone. This leads to sodium retention (hypernatremia), potassium excretion (hypokalemia), and hypertension. Crucially, the high aldosterone levels suppress renin production through negative feedback, distinguishing it from secondary hyperaldosteronism where renin is high."
