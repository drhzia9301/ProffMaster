    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Diazepam, like other benzodiazepines, enhances the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at GABA-A receptors. This increases the frequency of chloride channel opening, leading to an influx of chloride ions. This hyperpolarizes the neuronal membrane, making it less excitable and thus controlling seizures."

The question text has a contradiction saying 'all lymphocytes' then '90% neutrophils'. Assuming chronic presentation and lymphocytes dominates in TB usually, but mixed can occur early. However, TB is common in alcoholics/homeless. Note: Fluorochrome stain negative makes TB less likely on *smear*, but it's often negative. Let's reconsider. Alcoholic + confusion = Wernicke's? But febrile. Bacterial meningitis in alcoholic? Listeria/Strep. But cells are mixed. If the question implies lymphocytic dominance (despite the typo '90% neutrophils' which contradicts 'all lymphocytes'), TB or Fungal (Cryptococcus) are top differentials. Cryptococcus is common in immunocompromised. But TB is very common in homeless. Let's assume the question meant lymphocytes. TB meningitis fits the subacute course."

    "question": "A 70-year-old man has a 2 day history of worsening generalized headache and increasing obtundation. He previously complained of stiffness in his neck. On physical examination vital signs include T 38.7C, BP 150/85 mmHg, P 96/min, R 20/minute, and blood pressure 130/85 mmHg. A CBC reveals a WBC count of 16,850/microliter. Serum electrolytes include a glucose of 88 mg/dL. A lumbar puncture draws turbid cerebrospinal fluid with a glucose of 32 mg/dL, protein 148 mg/dL, and a total of 380 WBCs (95% PMN’s) per mm3, and is positive for gram-negative rods.

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The symptoms (tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness) point to a cerebellopontine angle lesion affecting the 8th cranial nerve. The most common tumor here is an Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma). However, it is not listed. Meningioma is the second most common. Medulloblastoma is a pediatric tumor. Ependymoma is rare here. If 'Acoustic Neuroma' is missing, Meningioma is the best fit among adults. However, the provided key/mark suggests Medulloblastoma, which is medically incorrect for this demographic and presentation. I will record the clinically most appropriate alternative from the list if valid, or note the discrepancy. Actually, Vestibular Schwannoma is synonymous with Acoustic Neuroma. Given the options, Meningioma is the most plausible adult CP angle tumor listed. If forced to follow a potentially erroneous key, I will note it."

If the 'most common age' (mode) was found to be 42, which is relatively young for colorectal cancer, and the distribution likely extends to older ages where the disease is also prevalent or more so (creating a long tail towards the right/older ages), it might be positively skewed. However, typically cancer age distributions are negatively skewed (tail towards younger ages, bulk at older). But if the *finding* was 42, this implies a younger cluster. Without more data, a bell curve is a standard assumption, but age-incidence curves are often skewed. Given 42 is young, a positive skew (tail to right) is standard for age distributions starting young."

Dysphasia is usually cortical (left hemisphere), but the 'crossed' signs strongly point to the brainstem. However, Dysphasia is typically a cortical sign. A brainstem lesion causing dysarthria is common, but true dysphasia implies cortex. If the question implies 'crossed signs', it's brainstem.
