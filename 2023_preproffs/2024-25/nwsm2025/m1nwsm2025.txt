His hearing becomes better when he got discharge but become worse when he get antibiotic for it and discharge becomes dry. What is the most common cause of hearing loss in this patient?",
"options": [
"a. adhesions of middle ear",
"b. Ossicular discontinuity",
"c. Tympanic membrane perforation",
"d. cochlear damage due to toxic absorption",
"e. Edema of the ear canal due to infection"
],
"answer": "b",
"explanation": "The phenomenon described is where sound transmission improves when the middle ear is filled with fluid (discharge) because the fluid bridges a gap in the ossicular chain. When the ear becomes dry, the gap re-emerges, and hearing worsens. This is characteristic of ossicular discontinuity."
