    "question": "A patient with a previously undiagnosed thyroid cancer presents with thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm). One drug that is administered as part of early management, and may be lifesaving, is propranolol. Which of the following best summarizes why we give this drug, or what we want it to do?",
    "options": [
      "a. Block parenchymal cell receptors for thyroid hormones",
      "b. Block thyroid hormone release by a direct effect on the gland",
      "c. Inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis",
      "d. Lessen dangerous cardiovascular signs and symptoms of thyroid hormone excess",
      "e. Lower TSH levels"
    ],
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used in thyroid storm primarily to control the life-threatening cardiovascular manifestations (tachycardia, arrhythmias) caused by the increased adrenergic tone. While it also blocks the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, its immediate lifesaving role is cardiovascular stabilization."

A digital rectal exam (DRE) confirms a symmetrically enlarged, smooth prostate. His post-void residual (PVR) ultrasound is 30 mL. Which of the following is the most likely primary pathophysiological mechanism responsible for this patient's predominant storage symptoms (frequency, urgency, nocturia)?",
