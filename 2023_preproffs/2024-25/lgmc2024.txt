    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the enlargement of the prostate gland, which can compress the urethra and cause a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). These include storage symptoms like urinary frequency and urgency, as well as voiding symptoms like hesitancy, straining to urinate, and post-void dribbling. Therefore, all the options listed are features of BPH."

TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) can be used to relieve urinary symptoms but is not a curative treatment for the cancer itself. The Gleason score is a grading system used to assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer from a biopsy sample; it is a diagnostic and prognostic tool, not a treatment."

    "explanation": "The standard of care for diagnosing a breast lump is the 'triple assessment'. This comprehensive approach includes three components: clinical breast examination, breast imaging (such as a mammogram and/or ultrasound), and a tissue sample for histology (like a core needle biopsy). Relying on only one of these methods is insufficient for a definitive diagnosis."

    "answer": "e",
    "explanation": "For a patient with a symptomatic fibroid who desires a definitive treatment but wishes to avoid surgery, Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) is an excellent option. UAE is a minimally invasive procedure where the blood supply to the fibroids is blocked, causing them to shrink and symptoms to improve. It preserves the uterus and is less invasive than a hysterectomy or myomectomy."

In invasive carcinoma, this myoepithelial layer is absent as the cancer cells have broken through the basement membrane. P63 is an immunohistochemical marker that specifically stains the nuclei of myoepithelial cells. Therefore, the presence of p63 staining would indicate DCIS, while its absence would support a diagnosis of invasive carcinoma."

The constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss) are also common. Importantly, RCC can cause paraneoplastic syndromes, including erythrocytosis (high hemoglobin/hematocrit) due to ectopic production of erythropoietin by the tumor.

In primary hyperthyroidism (the most common cause, e.g., Graves' disease), the thyroid gland produces excessive T3 and T4. This high level of thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback on the pituitary gland, suppressing the release of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Therefore, a decreased TSH level is expected."

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are a first-line treatment for managing PCOS symptoms in women not seeking pregnancy. They regulate the menstrual cycle by providing consistent hormone levels. Formulations containing an anti-androgen like cyproterone acetate are particularly effective at treating hirsutism and acne by blocking the effects of excess androgens."

      "e. Inhibition of iodine absorption in the gut"
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Methimazole and other thionamide drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO). This enzyme is crucial for the organification of iodine and the coupling of iodotyrosines, which are key steps in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. By blocking this synthesis, methimazole reduces the production of new thyroid hormones."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The copper IUD is a non-hormonal contraceptive.

It works by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the primary androgen responsible for prostate growth.

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "In a very young woman (20 years old) with severe uterine prolapse who wishes to preserve her uterus for future fertility, a hysterectomy is not appropriate. A sacrocolpopexy (if the uterus is removed) or sacrohysteropexy (if the uterus is preserved) is the best surgical option. This procedure uses a mesh to suspend the apex of the vagina or the uterus to the sacrum, providing strong, durable apical support while preserving the organs. It is considered the gold standard for apical prolapse, especially in young, active patients."
