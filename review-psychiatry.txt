Q1. ID: psychiatry_1185
Topic: PSYCHIATRY/GENERAL MEDICINE
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following indicates lithium toxicity?

Options:
  ✓ a. Coarse tremor
    b. Polyuria
    c. Vomiting
    d. T-wave inversion on the ECG
    e. Hypothyroidism

Marked Correct: a. Coarse tremor (index: 0)

Explanation:
A coarse tremor (distinct from the fine tremor seen as a common side effect) is a reliable sign of Lithium toxicity (>1.5-2.0 mEq/L). Vomiting is also an early sign, but coarse tremor is the classic neurological discriminator in exams. T-wave inversion, Polyuria, and Hypothyroidism are side effects of long-term use, not necessarily acute toxicity signs.
