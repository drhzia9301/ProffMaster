================================================================================
Question 1 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2 year old child presents with fever, headache, protraction and nuchal rigidity.The cerebrospinal fluid is cloudy and microscopic examination reveals innumerable neutrophils.The CFS protein is increased and glucose is decreased.The most likely etiologic agent is.

Options:
  Eschenchia coli
  Hemoplilis influenzae
  Group B streptococci
✓ Streptococcus pneumoniae
  Staphylococcus aureus

Explanation:
The clinical picture of meningitis in a 2-year-old child with cloudy CSF, numerous neutrophils, increased protein, and decreased glucose is characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. In this age group (beyond the neonatal period but still young childhood), *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is a very common causative agent. *Haemophilus influenzae* type B was common but its incidence has significantly reduced due to vaccination.

================================================================================
Question 2 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old female who has had progressive signs of central nervous system compression fully recovers following resection of an intracranial neoplasm.These clinical findings are highly suggestive of a specific diagnosis.Assuming that this diagnosis is correct.Which of the following is the most characteristic?

Options:
  Extra cranial metastasis
  Fried egg appearance of tumor cells
  Multiple areas of necrosis & hemorrhage within tumor
✓ Origin in arachnoidal cells of meninges
  Tumor cells arranged in rosette pattern

Explanation:
A benign intracranial neoplasm that causes CNS compression and is often curable by surgical resection, leading to full recovery, is highly suggestive of a meningioma. Meningiomas are typically slow-growing, encapsulated tumors that originate from the arachnoidal cap cells of the meninges.

================================================================================
Question 3 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In Axonot emesis following structure is disrupted.

Options:
✓ Axon
  Endoneurium
  Epineurium
  Perineurium
  Distal segment of nerve

Explanation:
Axonotmesis is a more severe form of peripheral nerve injury than neurapraxia. In axonotmesis, the axon itself is disrupted, but the surrounding connective tissue sheaths (endoneurium, perineurium, epineurium) remain relatively intact. This allows for Wallerian degeneration of the distal axon, followed by potential regeneration of the axon within the preserved connective tissue channels.

================================================================================
Question 4 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old man suddenly developed severe headache followed by neurologic deterioration and unconsciousness.CT scan showed rupture of arteriovenous aneurysm.What is the location of vascular injury in central nervous system?

Options:
  Cerebellum
  Epidural space
  Subdural space
✓ Subarachnoid space
  Intra parenchymal region

Explanation:
The rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or aneurysm typically leads to bleeding into the subarachnoid space, causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This is characterized by a sudden, severe headache and rapid neurological deterioration.

================================================================================
Question 5 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 year old boy presented with tinnitus and hearing loss.On CT scan a tumor was found at cerebellopontine angle .On biopsy microscopically the tumor show cellular areas that had spindle cells arranged into intersecting fascicles and hypocellular areas having myxoid extracellular matrix.What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Dermatofibroma
  Malignant peripheral nerve sheat tumor
  Neurofibroma
✓ Schwannoma
  Triton tumor

Explanation:
A tumor at the cerebellopontine (CP) angle presenting with tinnitus and hearing loss is highly suggestive of a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). Histologically, schwannomas are characterized by Antoni A areas (cellular areas with spindle cells in fascicles, often forming Verocay bodies) and Antoni B areas (hypocellular, myxoid matrix).

================================================================================
Question 6 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Vestibular schwannomas ,also called acoustic neuromas ,almost always arise from the vestibular division of the 8th cranial nerve.Which of the following is the Hallmark symptom of this condition?

Options:
  Dizziness
  Disequilibrium
  Sensation of pressure or fullness in the ear
✓ Slowly progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss
  Numbness in the face

Explanation:
The hallmark symptom of vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) is slowly progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, which is often accompanied by tinnitus and disequilibrium.

================================================================================
Question 7 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Most common tumor associated with Neurofibromatosis in children is?

Options:
  ML
✓ JMML (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
  ALL
  CML
  CLL

Explanation:
Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm that is strongly associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) in children. Approximately 10-15% of children with JMML also have NF1.

================================================================================
Question 8 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Weakness in myasthenia gravis is first noted in.

Options:
✓ Extraocular muscles
  Facial muscles
  Respiratory muscles
  Skeleton muscles
  Smooth muscle

Explanation:
In myasthenia gravis, the weakness most commonly and often first affects the extraocular muscles, leading to symptoms like ptosis (drooping eyelids) and diplopia (double vision). Facial and bulbar muscles are also frequently involved early in the disease course.

================================================================================
Question 9 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Myasthenia gravis is more common in women because.

Options:
  An x linked disorder
✓ An autoimmune disease
  Antibodies are present
  Presence of thymic hyperplasia
  Associated with thymoma

Explanation:
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, which are generally more prevalent in women, particularly in younger age groups. While the presence of antibodies and thymic abnormalities (hyperplasia or thymoma) are key features of the disease, the underlying autoimmune nature contributes to its higher incidence in women.

================================================================================
Question 10 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 year old female presented with ptosis, diplopia and generalized weakness. Her weakness increases with repeated movements.What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Brain tumor
  Encephalitis
  Lambert Eaton syndrome
✓ Myasthenia Gravis
  Tabes Disease

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of ptosis, diplopia, generalized weakness, and importantly, the worsening of weakness with repeated movements (fatigability) is highly characteristic of myasthenia gravis.

================================================================================
Question 11 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 year old man is referred to AE dept as he complains of severe headache and blurring of vision, the doctor on examination of CFS found it to be blood stained.What is the single most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Bacterial meningitis
  Epidural hematoma
✓ Subarachnoid hemorrhage
  Tuberculosis meningitis
  Viral Encephalitis

Explanation:
A severe headache, blurring of vision, and blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are classic findings in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The presence of blood in the CSF is a direct indicator of bleeding into the subarachnoid space.

================================================================================
Question 12 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
18 years male presented with headache high grade fever and severe vomiting from 3 days .On examination conscious oriented there is neck stiffness and petechial rash on the shin.On investigations raised WBC of 13.5, raised N/E shows Turbed appearance, polymorphonuclear cells (Neutrophils) 350/mm3, normal lymphocytes count and what is your diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Acute bacterial meningitis
  Brain abscess
  Cerebral Malaria
  Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
  Tuberculosis Meningitis

Explanation:
The constellation of high grade fever, headache, severe vomiting, neck stiffness, petechial rash, and CSF findings of increased polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils) strongly indicates acute bacterial meningitis, particularly meningococcal meningitis due to the petechial rash.

================================================================================
Question 13 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
15-year female presented with high grade fever with rigors ,headache and vomiting.On examination positive kernig's & Brudzinsk's signs diagnosed and treated as Acute bacterial meningitis .

Options:
  Name a bacteria causing meningitis
✓ What will be the glucose amount on CFS routine examination in this patient?
  What will be the polymorphonuclear cells count in CFS in this case
  None of the above

Explanation:
In acute bacterial meningitis, the CSF glucose level is typically decreased, often to less than 40% of the serum glucose level. This is due to the bacteria consuming glucose. The presence of high fever, rigors, headache, vomiting, and positive Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs are classic indicators of meningitis, and the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis implies these CSF changes.

================================================================================
Question 14 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old patient came to hospital with complaints of headache and vomiting.After completing investigations the diagnosis is made as Brain abscess.what will be the most common offending organism identified in non immunosuppressed patient?

Options:
  Candida and Nickersia
  Ecoli and Niasseria
  Neisseria and Ecoli
✓ Staphylococci and streptococci
  Taenia and Treponema

Explanation:
In non-immunosuppressed patients, brain abscesses are most commonly caused by polymicrobial infections, with *Staphylococci* (especially *Staphylococcus aureus*) and *Streptococci* (including aerobic, anaerobic, and microaerophilic species) being among the most frequent culprits. These often originate from contiguous infections like sinusitis, otitis media, or dental infections.

================================================================================
Question 15 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A HIV positive patient presents with fever , headache and conversations .On MRI multiple ring enhancing lesions seen . What will be the most possible diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Cerebral edema
✓ Cerebral Toxoplasmosis
  Meningioma
  Medulloblastoma
  Pilocytic astrocytoma

Explanation:
In an HIV-positive patient presenting with neurological symptoms (fever, headache, seizures) and multiple ring-enhancing lesions on MRI, cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of intracerebral mass lesions.

================================================================================
Question 16 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is Cushing's triad?

Options:
  Decrease ICP,HTN, Tachycardia
✓ Increase ICP,HTN, Bradycardia
  Increase ICP,HTN, Tachycardia
  Increase ICP, hypotension, Bradycardia
  Increase ICP, hypotension, Tachycardia

Explanation:
Cushing's triad is a classic physiological response to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). It consists of hypertension (increased blood pressure), bradycardia (slow heart rate), and irregular respirations. These signs indicate severe intracranial hypertension and impending brain herniation.

================================================================================
Question 17 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which is the most common brain tumor of posterior cranial fossa in children?

Options:
  Glioblastoma
  Hemangioma
  Encephalitis
✓ Glioma
  Meningitis

Explanation:
In children, the most common brain tumors of the posterior cranial fossa are generally gliomas (which include pilocytic astrocytomas, ependymomas, and brainstem gliomas) and medulloblastomas. Given 'Glioma' as a broad category that encompasses several of the most frequent types, it is the best answer among the options provided. Pilocytic astrocytoma and medulloblastoma are specifically very common.

================================================================================
Question 18 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which is the only nerve affected in multiple sclerosis?

Options:
  Abducent nerve
  Occular nerve
  Olfactory nerve
✓ Optic nerve
  Trigeminal nerve

Explanation:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease that can affect various parts of the central nervous system, including different cranial nerves. Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve) is a very common initial symptom or relapse in MS, often causing vision loss and eye pain. It is *not* the *only* nerve affected, as other cranial nerves (like abducent, trigeminal) and tracts can be involved, but optic nerve involvement is highly characteristic and frequent. The phrasing 'only nerve affected' in the question is biologically inaccurate, but among the choices, optic nerve is the most classically and frequently involved cranial nerve in MS, to the point of being considered a hallmark.

================================================================================
Question 19 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Meningitis is defined as inflammation of the meninges and Subarachnoid space and may be classified under several different categories.Of these categories,which of the following types is particularly serious due to the speed of its progression?

Options:
✓ Acute bacterial meningitis
  Aseptic meningitis
  Noninfectious meningitis
  Viral meningitis
  None of above

Explanation:
Acute bacterial meningitis is considered the most serious type of meningitis due to its rapid progression, potential for severe complications (such as brain damage, hearing loss, or death), and the need for urgent antibiotic treatment. Viral meningitis, while more common, is generally less severe and often self-limiting.

================================================================================
Question 20 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
When diagnosing meningitis,which of the following findings is a key indicator of meningeal irritation?

Options:
  Fever
  Headache
  Myalgia
✓ Nuchal rigidity
  All of above

Explanation:
Nuchal rigidity, or neck stiffness, is a key indicator of meningeal irritation in meningitis. While fever, headache, and myalgia are common symptoms, nuchal rigidity specifically points to inflammation of the meninges.

================================================================================
Question 21 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the major cause of dealt in my asthenia gravis?

Options:
  Auto immunity
  Myocardial infection
✓ Respiratory compromise
  Skeleton muscle weakness
  Stroke

Explanation:
The major cause of death in myasthenia gravis is respiratory compromise, which occurs during a myasthenic crisis. This is when the weakness of the respiratory muscles becomes so severe that the patient cannot breathe adequately, leading to respiratory failure.

================================================================================
Question 22 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young female presented in the OPD with throbbing,severe pain in head , pain is on one side of head, worsening with exertion, pain is associated with nausea, vomiting and photophobia.According to the patient she has these episodes for the last 08 months and the duration of this pain is mostly 4 to 22 hours .

Options:
  Tension type headache
  Cluster headache
  Trigeminal neuralgia
  Panic attacks
✓ Migraine headache

Explanation:
The symptoms of a throbbing, severe, unilateral headache, worsened by exertion, and associated with nausea, vomiting, and photophobia (light sensitivity), with a duration of 4 to 22 hours, are highly characteristic of a migraine headache.

================================================================================
Question 23 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 33 years old car driver survived in bad car accident y months ago, now for the last two months. He has flashbacks remembering the trauma over and over , with bad dreams , frightening thoughts , feeling tense , having difficulty in sleeping with angry outbursts,most of the time he is avoiding driving. Now he is detached from his friends and family members.what is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Personality disorder
  Acute stress disorder
  Panic anxiety disorder
✓ Post Traumatic stress disorder
  Depression

Explanation:
The cluster of symptoms including flashbacks, bad dreams, frightening thoughts, feeling tense, difficulty sleeping, angry outbursts, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli (driving), and detachment from others, occurring for more than one month after a traumatic event, is diagnostic of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

================================================================================
Question 24 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Serotonin

Options:
  Helps to regulate circadian rhythms
  Is an important regulator of sleep, appetite and libido
  Stores are increased by transient strees and depleted by chronic stress
  Permits or facilitates goal- directed motor and consummatory behavior in conjunction with norepinephrine and dopamine
✓ ALL of the above

Explanation:
Serotonin (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter with wide-ranging functions in the brain and body. It plays crucial roles in regulating mood, sleep, appetite, libido, and pain perception. It is also involved in circadian rhythms and its levels are influenced by stress. Its interaction with other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine is also important for various behaviors. Therefore, all the statements are correct regarding the functions of serotonin.

================================================================================
Question 25 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old gentlemen with a history of flue like symptoms 2 weeks back from which he is recovered.This morning when he woke up he is feeling weakness in his legs with parenthesis.His serum electrolytes showing potassium of 4.2 mnol/L . What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Hypokalemia
✓ Gullian Barre syndrome
  Hypomagnesemia
  Peripheral Neuropathy
  None of the above

Explanation:
The development of weakness in the legs with paresthesia, especially following a recent flu-like illness (suggesting a preceding infection), and normal serum potassium, is highly indicative of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune disorder triggered by infection, leading to demyelination of peripheral nerves and ascending paralysis.

================================================================================
Question 26 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years Lady presented with 2 day history of high grade fever, headache and vomiting. Now she is getting drowsy with feeling uneasy while moving her neck and wants to rest in a dark room.she is also feeling uneasy while at being examined at doctor's office in bright light. On investigations she is having TCL count of 15000 with a high CPR . Her CT brain didn't show any pathology. What is the next best investigation to reach the diagnosis?

Options:
  MRI Brain
  Blood culture
✓ Lumber puncture
  Serum electrolytes

Explanation:
The symptoms of high-grade fever, headache, vomiting, drowsiness, neck stiffness, and photophobia strongly suggest meningitis. Given the normal CT brain scan (ruling out contraindications like mass effect), the next best and crucial diagnostic step is a lumbar puncture to analyze the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for signs of infection.

================================================================================
Question 27 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 21 years old lady came with a 5 day history of high grade fever, severe headache and vomiting. On examination she is confused, and she is unable to tolerate light during examination.She is having neck stiffness with bilateral down going planters. Her investigations show HB of 13gm/dI. Her white cell counts is in 18000 with platelet count of 193000 and negative malarial parasite on blood smear . Her CPR is 150 . RBS is 95mg/dl and her Blood urea is 55 . What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute Delirium
  Febrile fits
  Encephalitis
✓ Meningitis
  Both a&b

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of high grade fever, severe headache, vomiting, confusion, photophobia, and neck stiffness are all classic signs and symptoms of meningitis. The elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein (CPR) further support an inflammatory or infectious process.

================================================================================
Question 28 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
40 years old lady presented with vague symptoms of generalized weakness from the last 6 months and felling tired at the end of the day. She was very active before that and use to do regular exercise . During the night she has also noticed double vision which she attributed to lack of enough sleep. On examination her power is 5/5 in All limbs and neurological examination is unremarkable. She is unable to maintain upward gaze during examination and her limbs feel weak after a brief period of exercise. On investigations she is having HB of 13gm/dl , RBS of 120mg/dl and potassium of 4.5mol/L . What is the most likely diagnosis.

Options:
  Hypokalemia periodic paralysis
  Guillian bare syndrome
✓ Myasthenia gravis
  Polymyositis
  None of the above

Explanation:
The key features of generalized weakness, double vision (diplopia), and the observation that weakness increases with activity or after a brief period of exercise (fatigability) are highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis. The inability to maintain upward gaze is also a common finding due to extraocular muscle weakness.

================================================================================
Question 29 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 years old man presented with chronic backache which is increasing in severity and he is having sleepless nights due to that . He also complaints of weight loss of around 8kgs in the last e months . He is running low grade fever most of the time. On examination he is bilateral hyperreflexia in the lower limbs with power of 4/5 . Investigations shows HB of 10gm/dl ,ESR of 90 and normal serum calcium plus renal function tests . X-ray thoracic spine shows decreased height of TIO and TII vertebrae. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Osteoporotic fracture of spine
✓ Caries (TB) spine
  Multiple myeloma
  Disc prolapse
  Both a &b

Explanation:
The chronic progressive backache, weight loss, low-grade fever, elevated ESR, and vertebral collapse (decreased height of T10 and T11 vertebrae) in an elderly man are highly suggestive of Caries (TB) spine, also known as Pott's disease. The bilateral hyperreflexia and weakness in the lower limbs indicate spinal cord compression from the vertebral destruction.

================================================================================
Question 30 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
60 years old gentlemen with a 10 years history of diabetes,HTN and Ex - smoker presented with sudden onset weakness of Left side of the body from the last 3 hours . He is unable to talk and is confused. He is having mouth deviation to the right side. He vomited once when he arrived to the hospital. On examination his BP is 200/110 and is having power of 0/5 in the left side of the body with left planter having extensor response. His RBS is 200/110 and CT Brian shows no abnormality. What is the most likely diagnosis.

Options:
  Multiple sclerosis
  Intracerebral bleed
✓ Ischemic CVA
  Hypertensive Encephalopathy

Explanation:
The sudden onset of left-sided weakness (hemiparesis/hemiplegia), inability to talk (dysphasia/aphasia), confusion, mouth deviation, and an extensor plantar response in a patient with significant risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, smoking) is classic for a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). While a CT scan may initially be normal in the very early stages of an ischemic stroke, the clinical presentation strongly points to an ischemic CVA. An intracerebral bleed would typically be visible on CT.

================================================================================
Question 31 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old gentlemen farmer by profession came with a 1 day history of low low grade fever, severe headache and occasional vomiting. On examination she is well oriented but feels uneasy to light during examination. She is having mild, neck stiffness with bilateral down going planters. Her investigations show HB of llgm/dl . Her white cell count is in 9000 with platelet count of 253000. His ESR is 50 with a CPR of 45. RBS is 125mg/dl and her Blood urea is 55. His CT brain showed mildly dilated ventricles . His CSF R.E showed cell count of 150 with predominant lymphocytes.CSF protein is 125mg/dl and CFS sugar of 50mg/dl .What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Hydrocephalus
  Acute bacterial meningitis
✓ Tuberculosis
  Viral meningitis
  Both a &b

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of low-grade fever, severe headache, vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness, combined with CSF findings of predominant lymphocytes, elevated protein (125mg/dL), and decreased glucose (50mg/dL, while blood glucose is 125mg/dL, indicating a CSF:blood glucose ratio of 0.4), is highly suggestive of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The elevated ESR and CPR, and mildly dilated ventricles (hydrocephalus can be a complication of TBM) further support this diagnosis, which often has a more insidious onset than acute bacterial meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 32 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
25 years old lady presented with sudden onset backache which is quite severe and she didn't sleep last due to pain. She had flue like symptoms from the last 2 days. She is also complaining of weakness in her lower limbs and she is unable to go to the bathroom by herself. There is no history of trauma or any weight lifting recently. He is running low grade fever today. On examination she is bilateral hyperreflexia in the lower limbs with power of 3/5 and bilateral up going planters. She is having a loss of sensations of all modalities up to the lower chest. Upper limb examination is normal. Investigations show HB of 13.5gm/dI, ESR of 20 . X-ray thoracic and cervical spine is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Anterior spinal artery occlusion
✓ Transverse myelitis
  Disc prolapse
  TB spine
  Both a &b

Explanation:
The sudden onset of severe backache, rapidly progressive lower limb weakness, loss of sensation up to the lower chest (sensory level), and upper motor neuron signs (hyperreflexia, upgoing plantars) following a flu-like illness is characteristic of acute transverse myelitis. This inflammatory condition affects a segment of the spinal cord, leading to neurological deficits below the level of the lesion. A normal X-ray rules out bony pathology like TB spine or significant disc prolapse.

================================================================================
Question 33 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A one year old child presented with history of fever ,fits and drowvinessn. On examination child is fibrile and is having bulging anterior fontanelle. Contraindications for lumber puncture in this child Will be.

Options:
  Bulging anterior fontanelle
  Generalized tonic clonic seizure
✓ Shock
  Fever more than 103F
  Nasal regurgitation

Explanation:
While a bulging anterior fontanelle is a sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which is a relative contraindication for lumbar puncture, the absolute contraindication in this scenario would be shock. In a child presenting with fever, fits, drowsiness, and a bulging fontanelle, the priority is to stabilize the patient, and shock (indicating hemodynamic instability) is a critical contraindication to LP due to the risk of worsening perfusion and herniation in an already compromised patient. Increased ICP is a *relative* contraindication often requiring a CT scan before LP.

================================================================================
Question 34 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Epidural anesthesia is preferred to spinal anesthesia because

Options:
  Hypotension is absent
✓ Dura is not penetrated
  Low dose of anesthesia is used
  Level of blood logically changed
  Easy to perform

Explanation:
In epidural anesthesia, the local anesthetic is injected into the epidural space (outside the dura mater), meaning the dura is not intentionally penetrated. This reduces the risk of post-dural puncture headache, a common complication of spinal anesthesia where the dura is intentionally punctured.

================================================================================
Question 35 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Post spinal headache is prevented by.

Options:
✓ Use of thinner needles
  NSAIDS
  Preanesthetic medication
  Plenty of oral fluids
  Pre-op leading

Explanation:
Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH), commonly known as post-spinal headache, occurs due to leakage of CSF through the dural puncture site. Using thinner (smaller gauge) spinal needles minimizes the size of the dural hole, thereby reducing CSF leakage and the incidence of PDPH.

================================================================================
Question 36 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The most common complication of spinal anesthesia is

Options:
  Post spinal headache
✓ Hypotension
  Meningitie
  Arrhythmias
  Nausea and Vomiting

Explanation:
The most common and significant complication of spinal anesthesia is hypotension. This occurs due to sympathetic blockade, which causes vasodilation and decreased venous return, leading to a drop in blood pressure.

================================================================================
Question 37 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
18 years old boy was brought to emergency department with a history of loss of consciousness and generalized tonic clonic fits from the last 1 hour. He has r episodes of fits in the last 1 hour lasting 5 to 6 mins.He is having blood in his mouth and had incontinence. His RBS is 105 m/dl and serum sodium of 138mmol/l . He again developed fits which in emergency which were not resolving. After securing his airway and checking his vitals what is the choice of medication in the management of this patient in emergency situation.

Options:
✓ IV Lorazepam
  IV Diazepam
  IV sodium Valproate
  IV Levetiracetam
  None of the above

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with prolonged, continuous, or recurrent seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures (status epilepticus) is an emergency. Intravenous benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam or diazepam, are the first-line treatment for aborting status epilepticus due to their rapid onset of action and efficacy in enhancing GABAergic inhibition.

================================================================================
Question 38 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
CFS culture growth shows if influenzae type b as the causative organism. The best prophylaxis regimen for house hold contacts is.

Options:
✓ Rifampicin 20mg/kg/day for 4 days
  Rifampicin 10mg/kg/day for 10 days
  Trimethoprim is the drug of choice for prophylaxis
  1st do the bacteriological conformation of contract
  vaccine is the only effective way of prophylaxis

Explanation:
When *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) is identified as the cause of meningitis, chemoprophylaxis with rifampicin is recommended for close household contacts to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage and prevent secondary cases. The recommended dosage for prophylaxis is 20 mg/kg/day for 4 days (maximum 600 mg/day).

================================================================================
Question 39 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26 -year-old Female had frequent episodes of focal left hand shaking followed by generalized tonic clonic seizure. She broke her jaw and her right shoulder due to fall , routine ECG is normal and brain imaging is unremarkable. Which would be the most appropriate drug for this patient?

Options:
  Lamotrigine
✓ Oxcarbazepine
  Phenobarbital
  Topiramate
  Valproate

Explanation:
The description of focal left hand shaking followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures indicates focal-onset seizures (which then generalize). Oxcarbazepine is a commonly used and effective antiepileptic drug for focal-onset seizures. It is generally well-tolerated and often a first-line choice.

Question 40 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient is experiencing insomnia and their doctor prescribes a hypotonic drug to help them sleep. What is the mechanism of action of hypnotic drugs?

Options:
  Activate the serotonin receptor
  Block the action of histamine
  Increase the production of melatonin
  Inhibit the release of acetylcholine
✓ Stimulate the GABA receptor

Explanation:
Many commonly used hypnotic drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics ('Z-drugs'), primarily exert their effects by stimulating or enhancing the activity of the GABA-A receptor. This increases GABAergic inhibition in the brain, leading to sedation and sleep induction.

================================================================================
Question 41 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient has been taking a hypotonic drug for a few weeks to help with their insomnia. They are concerned about becoming dependent on the drug. Which of the following is a potential risk of long term use of hypnotic drugs?

Options:
  Decreased heart rate
  Increased risk of seizure
  Liver demage
  Respiratory depression
✓ Tolerance and dependence

Explanation:
Long-term use of many hypnotic drugs, especially benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, carries a significant risk of developing tolerance (requiring higher doses for the same effect) and physical and psychological dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can occur if the drug is stopped abruptly.

================================================================================
Question 42 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is a commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia?

Options:
  Clonazepam
  Diazepam
  Phenobarbital
✓ Risperidone
  Zolpidem

Explanation:
Risperidone is a widely used and commonly prescribed atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Clonazepam and diazepam are benzodiazepines, phenobarbital is an anticonvulsant, and zolpidem is a hypnotic.

================================================================================
Question 43 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient has been prescribed a hypotonic drug to help with their insomnia, but they have a history of alcohol abuse. All of the following are potential risk of combining hypnotic drugs with alcohol except one?

Options:
✓ Decreased sedation
  Impaired coordination
  Increased sedation
  Memory impairment
  Respiratory depression

Explanation:
Both hypnotic drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) and alcohol are central nervous system depressants. Combining them leads to synergistic depressant effects, resulting in increased sedation, impaired coordination, memory impairment, and a heightened risk of respiratory depression. Decreased sedation would not be a risk; instead, excessive sedation is the concern.

================================================================================
Question 44 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the primary mechanism of action for most anti Parkinson drugs?

Options:
  Blocking dopamine receptors
  Enhancing dopamine release
  Inhibiting dopamine reuptake
  Increasing dopamine degradation
✓ None of the above

Explanation:
The primary underlying pathology in Parkinson's disease is the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a deficiency of dopamine. Therefore, most anti-Parkinson drugs aim to *increase* dopamine activity in the brain, either by replacing dopamine (levodopa), mimicking dopamine (dopamine agonists), enhancing its release, or inhibiting its degradation. Options a-d do not fully or accurately capture this overarching mechanism. Thus, 'None of the above' is the most accurate choice because the correct answer (increasing dopamine activity) is not explicitly listed as one of the direct options for 'primary mechanism of action'.

================================================================================
Question 45 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following anti Parkinson drugs is a dopamine agonist?

Options:
  Amantadine
  Carbidopa
  Levodopa
  Selegiline
✓ Pramipexole

Explanation:
Pramipexole is a non-ergot dopamine agonist that directly stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain, mimicking the effects of dopamine. Amantadine has complex mechanisms, levodopa is a dopamine precursor, carbidopa is a decarboxylase inhibitor, and selegiline is an MAO-B inhibitor.

================================================================================
Question 46 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following is not anti Parkinson drug?

Options:
  Apomorphine
  Bromocriptine
✓ Donepezil
  Entacapone
  Ropinirole

Explanation:
Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease to improve cognitive function. Apomorphine, bromocriptine, entacapone, and ropinirole are all medications used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

================================================================================
Question 47 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which anti Parkinson drug is a COMT inhibitor?

Options:
  Amantadine
  Levodopa
  Pramipexole
  Selegiline
✓ Tolcapone

Explanation:
Tolcapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. COMT inhibitors are used as adjuncts to levodopa/carbidopa therapy in Parkinson's disease to prolong the duration of levodopa's effect by reducing its peripheral metabolism.

================================================================================
Question 48 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following drugs is not commonly used for the treatment of Parkinson?

Options:
✓ Carbamazepine
  Fluphenazine
  Lithium
  Olanzapine
  Valproic acid

Explanation:
Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer used for seizures and bipolar disorder, not commonly for Parkinson's disease. Fluphenazine and olanzapine are antipsychotics (some atypical antipsychotics might be used cautiously for Parkinson's psychosis, but typically not these), lithium is a mood stabilizer, and valproic acid is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. None of these are first-line treatments for Parkinson's motor symptoms. However, if the question implies 'not *any* use' related to Parkinson's, then fluphenazine and olanzapine (typical and atypical antipsychotics respectively) are often avoided or used with extreme caution in Parkinson's due to potential to worsen motor symptoms, but atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine are sometimes used for Parkinson's psychosis. Given the options, Carbamazepine, Lithium, and Valproic acid are primarily used for other neurological/psychiatric conditions and have no direct role in Parkinson's disease treatment. The question is phrased 'not commonly used', making it slightly ambiguous. But Carbamazepine is a definite non-Parkinson drug here for its primary indication.

================================================================================
Question 49 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following drugs is a dopamine agonist and used for the treatment of Parkinson disease?

Options:
  Carbidopa
  Donepezil
  Entacapone
  Levodopa
✓ Pramipexole

Explanation:
Pramipexole is a non-ergot dopamine agonist that directly stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain, effectively treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Carbidopa and entacapone are adjuncts to levodopa, levodopa is a precursor, and donepezil is for Alzheimer's.

================================================================================
Question 50 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male patient, using warfarin,is presented to OPD with increase bleeding tendency. On inquiring he also uses antifungal drug regularly. What is that antifungal drug which causes enzyme Inhibition of warfarin?

Options:
  Nystatin
  Amphoterian
✓ Ketoconazole
  Tetracycline
  Micronazole

Explanation:
Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes (particularly CYP3A4). Warfarin is metabolized by CYP enzymes, and inhibition of these enzymes by ketoconazole can lead to increased warfarin levels and a heightened risk of bleeding.

================================================================================
Question 51 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Analgesia , euphoria, respiratory depression associated with morphine are probably mediated mainly through this opioid receptor type.

Options:
  Kappa
  Delta
✓ Mu
  a & b
  both b & c

Explanation:
The mu (μ) opioid receptor is primarily responsible for the classic opioid effects of analgesia, euphoria, and respiratory depression, which are strongly associated with morphine's pharmacological profile.

================================================================================
Question 52 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young woman recently diagnosed as schizophrenic developed severe muscle spasm with torticoilis , Shortly after therapy with haloperidol. The best treatment for muscle spasms will be.

Options:
  Add resperidone with haloperidol
  Discontinue haloperidol
  Oral diphenhydramine
  Oral lithium
✓ Inject benatropine

Explanation:
Acute dystonia, such as torticollis and severe muscle spasms, is an acute extrapyramidal side effect commonly seen with typical antipsychotics like haloperidol due to D2 receptor blockade. The most effective treatment for acute dystonia is parenteral (intramuscular or intravenous) anticholinergic agents like benztropine or diphenhydramine.

================================================================================
Question 53 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years old women recently diagnosed as bipolar disorder and on medication presents with 5 weeks pregnancy. Which of the following drug is safe and effective to be used in pregnancy?

Options:
  Carbamazepine
  Fluphenazine
✓ Lithium
  Olanzapine
  Valproic acid

Explanation:
While most mood stabilizers carry risks in pregnancy, lithium is generally considered a relatively safer option compared to carbamazepine and valproic acid, which have significant teratogenic potential (e.g., neural tube defects for valproate, facial clefts for carbamazepine). Lithium's teratogenic risk (Ebstein's anomaly) is generally considered lower, especially when carefully monitored, and its use is often weighed against the risks of untreated bipolar disorder in pregnancy. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is also often considered in pregnancy for bipolar disorder, but lithium is a primary mood stabilizer. Given the options, lithium is a relatively common and considered option for bipolar disorder in pregnancy with careful monitoring.

================================================================================
Question 54 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 34 years old man was prescribed citalopram for depression but he stop taking it. The reason for discontinuation he told was its effect on his sexual performance. What will be the best choice of drug for this patient?

Options:
  Amitriptyline
✓ Bupropion
  Flouxetine
  Impramine
  Venlafaxine

Explanation:
Sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido and anorgasmia, is a common side effect of SSRIs like citalopram. Bupropion is an antidepressant that works primarily through norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition and is known for having a lower incidence of sexual side effects compared to SSRIs and SNRIs, making it a good alternative for patients who experience sexual dysfunction with other antidepressants.

================================================================================
Question 55 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old with history of alcoholism is brought to ER department in confused and delirious state. He has truncal ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. The most appropriate immediate treatment is

Options:
  Chlordiazepoxide
  Disulfiram
  Folic acid
  Glucosamine
✓ Thiamine

Explanation:
The symptoms of confusion, delirium, truncal ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia in an alcoholic patient are classic signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy, an acute neurological emergency caused by severe thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. Immediate intravenous administration of thiamine is critical to prevent permanent neurological damage or death.

================================================================================
Question 56 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old patient with history of pulmonary disease with essential tremors. Which drug is most suitable for the treatment?

Options:
  Diazepam
  Levodopa
✓ Metoprolol
  Propranolol
  Terbutaline

Explanation:
Propranolol (a non-selective beta-blocker) is often the first-line treatment for essential tremor. However, in a patient with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma, COPD), non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol are contraindicated due to the risk of bronchospasm. Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker (beta-1 selective) and is generally considered safer for essential tremor in patients with pulmonary disease as it has less effect on bronchial beta-2 receptors.

================================================================================
Question 57 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 year young girl present with amenorrhea and galactorrhea,her prolactin levels are grossly high . What will be the drug mostly used in her treatment?

Options:
✓ Bromocriptine
  Haloperidol
  Ketanserine
  LSD
  Terbutaline

Explanation:
Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and elevated prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia) are characteristic. Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, is a first-line treatment for hyperprolactinemia, often caused by pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas), as it suppresses prolactin secretion.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Question:
Convulsions like in tetanus can be seen in the following Acute poisoning due to .

Options:
  Morphine
  Amphetamine
✓ Cocaine
  LSD
  Heroin

Explanation:
Cocaine is a potent central nervous system stimulant. In acute severe poisoning, it can cause seizures and convulsions that can resemble the spasms seen in tetanus (though the underlying mechanisms are different, both involve intense muscular activity). Amphetamines can also cause seizures. However, between cocaine and amphetamine, cocaine's acute toxicity is often associated with more severe and rapid onset of seizures.

================================================================================
Question 60 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The clinical use of codeine is as.

Options:
✓ Cough syrup
  Antipyretic
  Analgesic
  Anti histaminic
  Antibiotic

Explanation:
Codeine is an opioid that is commonly used as an antitussive (cough suppressant) in cough syrups due to its action on the cough center in the brain. It also has analgesic properties but is less potent than morphine.

  Brown sugar
  Ganja
✓ Amphetamine

Explanation:
Chronic amphetamine abuse can lead to a state of amphetamine psychosis, characterized by paranoid delusions, hallucinations, and repetitive, purposeless, stereotyped behaviors (e.g., incessant sorting, picking at skin). This is related to excessive dopamine activity.

================================================================================
Question 70 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The body may be seen in the following postures in acute strychnine poisoning except;

Options:
  Opisthotonos
  Emprosthotones
  Pleurosthotones
  Hyperflexion
✓ Flaccid

Explanation:
Strychnine poisoning causes generalized tonic-clonic convulsions with severe muscle spasms, which can lead to various abnormal postures such as opisthotonos (arching backward), emprosthotonos (arching forward), and pleurosthotonos (arching sideways). The muscles are in a state of extreme rigidity and spasm, not flaccid. Flaccidity is the opposite of rigidity.

================================================================================
Question 71 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The main site of action of strychnine is at ;

Options:
  Vasomotor centres
  Cerebral cortex
✓ Anterior horn cells
  Respiratory centres
  Hypothalamus

Explanation:
Strychnine acts as a competitive antagonist at glycine receptors, particularly in the spinal cord. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, especially at the anterior horn cells. By blocking glycine's inhibitory action, strychnine leads to uncontrolled excitation of motor neurons, resulting in exaggerated reflexes and severe muscle spasms.

================================================================================
Question 76 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a descriptive study the sample mean for serum cholesterol level is 150 and standard error is 5.what is the 95% confidence interval for population mean?

Options:
  145 to 155
  140 to 155
✓ 140 to 160
  150 to 160
  205 to 235

Explanation:
The 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the population mean is calculated as: Sample Mean ± (Z-score * Standard Error). Sample Mean = 150. Standard Error (SE) = 5. For a 95% CI, the Z-score is approximately 1.96. Margin of Error = 1.96 * 5 = 9.8. CI = 150 ± 9.8, which is approximately 140.2 to 159.8. Therefore, the closest option is 140 to 160.

Question 82 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a class of 140 medical students, the mean systolic blood pressure was found to be 120 mmHg with a standard deviation of 5 mmHg .1f the blood pressures in this sample are normally distributed.What portion of medical students will have systolic blood pressure above 130 mmHg?

Options:
  0.5%
✓ 2.4%

Explanation:
To find the portion of students with systolic blood pressure above 130 mmHg, we calculate the Z-score: Z = (X - Mean) / Standard Deviation = (130 - 120) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2. A Z-score of 2 means the value is 2 standard deviations above the mean. In a normal distribution, approximately 2.28% of the data falls above +2 standard deviations. Among the given options, 2.4% is the closest to 2.28%.

================================================================================
Question 83 (GMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A large study in a hospital was conducted to find association between cigarette smoking and blood cancer .Bladder cancer patients with past history of Schistosomiasis infection is ?

Options:
✓ Confounding variable
  Dependent variable
  Independent variable
  Outcome variable
  Predictor variable

Explanation:
In an epidemiological study investigating the association between an exposure (e.g., cigarette smoking) and an outcome (e.g., blood cancer), a confounding variable is an extraneous factor that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome and distorts the true relationship. If the study were also considering bladder cancer, and a past history of schistosomiasis infection is a known risk factor for bladder cancer, schistosomiasis could act as a confounder if not accounted for.

================================================================================

================================================================================
Question 122 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the primary mechanism of action for most anti-Parkinson drugs?

Options:
  a. Blocking dopamine receptors
  b. Enhancing dopamine release
  c. Inhibiting dopamine reuptake
  d. Increasing dopamine degradation
✓ e. None of the above

Explanation:
Anti-Parkinson drugs work primarily by increasing dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia. Levodopa is converted to dopamine, dopamine agonists directly stimulate receptors, MAO-B/COMT inhibitors reduce dopamine breakdown, and Amantadine enhances release. Since none of the listed options (blocking receptors, enhancing release specifically, inhibiting reuptake, increasing degradation) correctly describe the primary mechanism for the drug class overall, 'None of the above' is the correct answer.

Question 135 (GMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A college student is brought to the emergency department by friends holding him down. The physician is informed that the student had taken some drug and then went crazy. The patient is agitated and delirious. On examination, his skin is warm and sweaty, his pupils are dilated, bowel sounds are normal, tachycardia, marked hypertension, hyperthermia, increased muscle tone, and both horizontal and vertical nystagmus. The management of this patient is likely to include:

Options:
  a. Administration of epinephrine
✓ b. Alkalinization of urine
  c. Atropine to control hyperthermia
  d. Amitriptyline if psychosis ensues

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of agitation, horizontal and vertical nystagmus, hypertension, hyperthermia, and increased muscle tone is classic for Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication.

  Tuberculous meningitis
  Accute demylenating encephalomylitis
✓ MS
  Thiamine def
  Vit b 12 def

Explanation:
A severe burning sensation triggered by warm water (often a form of heat sensitivity or Lhermitte's sign), along with receiving steroid treatment from a neurologist for a chronic neurological disease, is highly suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Heat sensitivity and various sensory disturbances are common in MS, and corticosteroids are used for acute relapses.

Question 243 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Miss XYZ, a 26 yrs old banker was diagnose of a case schizophrenia, she was started on 10 mg haloperidol. A week after treatment she developed body rigidity , fever and confusion. She was also irritable and her bp and body temp kept fluctuating. Probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Meningitis
  Serotinin syndrome
  Accute dystonia
  Anti-psychotics discontinuation syndrome
✓ Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

Explanation:
The development of severe body rigidity, fever, confusion, and autonomic instability (fluctuating blood pressure and body temperature) in a patient recently started on an antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) is the classic presentation of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a rare but life-threatening idiosyncratic reaction to antipsychotics.

================================================================================
Question 244 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A previously healthy 4 year old present to emergency department with nausea and vomiting for 2 hour with waddling gait and nystagmus there are other sick contact at home. He has no meningeal signs. What important question you will ask in history.

Options:
  Birth asphaxia
  Consanguinity history
✓ Drug history
  Maternal uncle's history
  Seizure disorder

Explanation:
In an acutely ill child presenting with neurological symptoms like nausea, vomiting, waddling gait (ataxia), and nystagmus, a thorough drug history is crucial. Accidental ingestion of medications (e.g., sedatives, anticonvulsants) or toxins is a common and important differential diagnosis that must be quickly ruled out, as it can be life-threatening. While a sick contact suggests infection, drug overdose is an emergent consideration.

================================================================================
Question 245 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12 yr old presented to ER with high fever 102.2F and severe headach. Lumbar puncture(LP .is performed and your suspection of septic meningitis is confirmed. What is the most likely CSF findings that occur in 48hrs of meningitis??

Options:
  50 WBC , 70% monocytes
  50 WBC , 8000 RBCs
  100 WBC, 90% eosinophils
  150WBC, 80%lymphocytes
✓ 5000WBC, 90%polymorph nuclear cells

Explanation:
In confirmed septic (bacterial) meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically shows a markedly elevated white blood cell count (often in the thousands), with a strong predominance of polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils, usually >80-90%), decreased glucose, and elevated protein. Option (e) accurately reflects these characteristic findings.

================================================================================
Question 246 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A four year old child unvaccinated presented in children OLD with complaints for fever , headache and vomiting for the last four weeks. On examination child is drowsy, emaciation and wasting

Options:
  Aseptic meningitis
  Brain abscess
  Cerebral malaria
  Septic meningitis
✓ Tuberculous meningitis

Explanation:
A chronic presentation (four weeks) of fever, headache, vomiting, drowsiness, and signs of poor nutrition (emaciation, wasting) in an unvaccinated child, particularly in a region where tuberculosis is endemic, is highly suggestive of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). TBM often has an insidious onset and chronic course, unlike acute bacterial meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 247 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A one yr old child has excessive crying with fever and fits.On examination he has fontonasal bosing and brisk reflexes What procedure should be used for confirmation of the case

Options:
  Fundoscopy
✓ Lumbar puncture
  CT brain
  MRI brain

Explanation:
A child with fever, fits (seizures), excessive crying, and a bulging fontanelle is highly suspicious for meningitis. While a CT scan is often performed *before* a lumbar puncture (LP) if there are significant signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) to rule out a mass lesion, the lumbar puncture itself (for CSF analysis) is the definitive and *confirmatory* procedure for diagnosing meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 248 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2 years child is a diagnosed case of cerebral palsy.he has ataxic gait.how will u classify the ataxia?

Options:
  Acute ataxia
  Chronic progressive ataxia
✓ Chronic non progressive ataxia
  Intermittent ataxia
  Paraxosymal ataxia

Explanation:
Cerebral palsy is a group of permanent neurological disorders that affect movement and muscle tone, appearing in early childhood. Crucially, the brain damage that causes cerebral palsy is *non-progressive*, meaning it does not worsen over time, even though the symptoms may change or become more apparent as the child grows. Therefore, ataxia in a child with diagnosed cerebral palsy is classified as chronic non-progressive ataxia.

================================================================================
Question 249 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which clinical risk factor is considered to hold highest positive correlate for postoperative cardiac complications?

Options:
  Age>70
  Aortic stenosis
  Arrhythmia other than sinus
  Emergency surgery
✓ Signs of heart failure:jugular venous distension & ventricular gallop

Explanation:
Among the clinical risk factors for postoperative cardiac complications, overt or decompensated heart failure, indicated by signs such as jugular venous distension and a ventricular gallop (S3), is considered one of the strongest predictors of adverse cardiac events.

================================================================================
Question 250 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 yr old came to psychiatry opd for bipolar affective disorder, she was started on treatment. She came next day with extrapyramidal symptoms . Which drug is responsible:

Options:
✓ Haloperidol
  Fluoxetine
  Escitalopram
  Quietiapine
  Amytriptyline

Explanation:
Haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic that is well-known for causing a high incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as acute dystonia, parkinsonism, and akathisia, due to its strong D2 dopamine receptor blockade. While atypical antipsychotics (like quetiapine) can be used for bipolar disorder and have a lower EPS risk, haloperidol is the most likely culprit for acute EPS among the options.

================================================================================
Question 251 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following anxiolytic drug noted for it's lack of sedation

Options:
  Hydroxyzine
  Diazepam
  Oxazepam
  Alprazolam
✓ Buspiron

Explanation:
Buspirone (Buspiron) is an anxiolytic that differs from benzodiazepines in its mechanism of action (it's a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist). A notable advantage of buspirone is its anxiolytic effect without significant sedative, hypnotic, or muscle relaxant properties, and it has a lower potential for dependence compared to benzodiazepines.

================================================================================
Question 252 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Anticholinergic drugs are used in the treatment of Parkinsonism because of its mechanism of ...

Options:
  Dec Ach from loss of neurons
  lnc degeneration of dopaminergic neurons
✓ imbalance of neurotransmitters in basal ganglia
  lncrease Acetylcholinesterases
  increase GABA action at Cl channel

Explanation:
Parkinsonism involves an imbalance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the basal ganglia, with dopamine deficiency leading to a relative excess of cholinergic activity. Anticholinergic drugs reduce this cholinergic overactivity, thereby helping to restore the balance and alleviate some Parkinsonian symptoms, particularly tremor and rigidity.

================================================================================
Question 253 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Baclofen is used to treat muscle specificity through which of following.

Options:
✓ as receptor agonist at GABAb.
  Block acetylcholine receptor
  Enhances release of GABA vesicles
  As an antagonist at glutamate receptor
  lnc GABA action at CL Channel

Explanation:
Baclofen is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used to treat spasticity. Its primary mechanism of action is acting as an agonist at GABA-B receptors (GABAb receptors). Activation of these presynaptic receptors inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, leading to muscle relaxation.

================================================================================
Question 254 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which anesthetic has a low blood:gas partition coefficient but is not used for induction of anesthesia because of airway irritation?

Options:
  Enflurane
✓ Desflurane
  Isoflurane
  Sevflurane
  Halothane

Explanation:
Desflurane has a very low blood:gas partition coefficient, which means it has a rapid onset and offset of action. However, it is known to be irritating to the airway, making it unsuitable for inhalational induction of anesthesia, especially in awake patients or those with reactive airway disease. Sevoflurane, with a slightly higher coefficient, is preferred for induction due to its less irritating properties.

================================================================================
Question 255 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A drug that increase serotonin reuptake selectively but not norepinephrine or dopamine. What is the drug?

Options:
  Amitriptyline
  Imipramine
✓ Fluoxetine
  Venlafaxine
  Mirtazapine

Explanation:
Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Its primary mechanism of action is to selectively block the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) into presynaptic neurons, thereby increasing serotonin concentrations in the synaptic cleft, without significant effects on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake.

================================================================================
Question 256 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The adverse effect profile of Naloxone does not contain :

Options:
  Hypertension
  Pulmonary edema
  Seizures
  Ventricular disrythmia
✓ Dysphoria

Explanation:
Naloxone is an opioid antagonist. While it can precipitate acute opioid withdrawal in dependent individuals, leading to a host of symptoms and physiological complications (including hypertension, pulmonary edema, seizures, and arrhythmias), dysphoria is a subjective symptom that is *part of* the precipitated withdrawal syndrome, rather than a direct pharmacological adverse effect of naloxone itself in isolation.

================================================================================
Question 257 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 years old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy. She has exerienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemisphere stroke her primary care physician started her on phenytoin which resulted in rash. Which other drug can be prescribed to her .:

Options:
✓ Carbamazepine
  Phenobarbitone
  Valproate
  Zonisamide

Explanation:
For partial (focal) seizures, after a patient experiences a rash with phenytoin (often indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction), alternative anticonvulsants for focal seizures are considered. Carbamazepine is a well-established first-line agent for focal seizures and is a suitable alternative. Phenobarbital has more sedative effects, valproate is often used for generalized seizures, and zonisamide is a broad-spectrum AED.

================================================================================
Question 258 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a patient with seizure disorder which of the following antidepressant is contraindicated?

Options:
  Nefazodone
  Fluoxetine
  Venlafaxine
  Mirtazipine
✓ Bupropion

Explanation:
Bupropion is an antidepressant known to lower the seizure threshold, especially at higher doses or in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders. Therefore, it is generally contraindicated or used with extreme caution in patients with epilepsy or a history of seizures.

================================================================================
Question 259 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old man with Absent seizures is treated with ethosuximide. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the mentioned drug?

Options:
✓ T type calcium channel blockade
  lnc in frequency of cl channels opening
  lnc in GABA
  lnc K+ channels permeability
  Na+ channels blockade

Explanation:
Ethosuximide is the drug of choice for absence seizures, and its primary mechanism of action is the selective blockade of T-type calcium channels in the thalamic neurons. This reduces the oscillatory activity responsible for the spike-and-wave discharges seen in absence seizures.

================================================================================
Question 260 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
marques test is done for :

Options:
  Arsenic poisoning
✓ Morphine poisoning
  Organophosphorous poisoning
  Mercury poisoning
  Cyanide poisoning

Explanation:
The Marquis test is a common presumptive chemical test used to detect the presence of various alkaloids, including opioids like morphine and heroin. A purple or violet color indicates the presence of opiates.

================================================================================
Question 261 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Other than drunkness a case of dhatura poisoning maybe mistaken for

Options:
  Barbiturate automatism
  Diabetic coma
  Dry burns
✓ Heat stroke
  Hypothermia

Explanation:
Dhatura poisoning (anticholinergic syndrome) presents with symptoms such as hot, dry, flushed skin, dilated pupils, tachycardia, and altered mental status (delirium). These symptoms closely mimic those of heat stroke, which also involves hyperthermia, dry skin, and altered consciousness due to impaired thermoregulation.

================================================================================
Question 262 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Different feature of opium poisoning from potine hemorrhage

Options:
✓ Diastatic Fracture
  Close fracture
  Fissure fracture
  Open fracture
  Linear fracture

Explanation:
The question asks about distinguishing features between opium poisoning and pontine hemorrhage, but the provided options are types of skull fractures. This is a clear mismatch between the question and the options, making it unanswerable as presented.

================================================================================
Question 263 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Poison which cause excitement then narcosis

Options:
✓ Inebriant
  Hypnotic
  Sedative
  Somniferous

Explanation:
Some inebriant poisons, notably alcohol, can cause an initial phase of excitement and disinhibition at lower doses, followed by central nervous system depression and narcosis as the dose increases or the effects deepen. Other CNS depressants can also exhibit a brief excitatory phase.

================================================================================
Question 264 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Regarding metabolism of heroin it is reduced/metabolised to

Options:
✓ Morphine
  Oxymorphine
  Hydromorphone
  Mepiridine
  Ethyl morphine

Explanation:
Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is a prodrug that is rapidly metabolized in the body. It is deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and then further to morphine, which is the primary active metabolite responsible for most of its pharmacological effects.

================================================================================
Question 265 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Sign of opium posioning?

Options:
  Lacrimation
  Salivation
  Sweating
✓ In continence of defecation
  In continence of micturation

Explanation:
While the classic signs of opioid (opium) poisoning include miosis, respiratory depression, and central nervous system depression, severe overdose can lead to profound muscle relaxation and loss of sphincter control, resulting in urinary and fecal incontinence. Lacrimation, salivation, and sweating are more characteristic of opioid withdrawal.

================================================================================
Question 266 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The police brought a dead body to mortuary for autopsy with history of suicidal poisoning, the medicolegal officer when entered the mortuary noted raw fish like smell emitting from the body which is may be due to:

Options:
✓ Barbiturates poisoning
  Cannabis poisoning
  Cyanide poisoning
  Opium poisoning
  Organophosphorus poisoning

Explanation:
A 'raw fish-like smell' is not a characteristic odor associated with any of the listed common poisonings in forensic toxicology. Cyanide has a bitter almond smell (though not everyone can detect it), and organophosphates can have a garlic-like odor. This question may refer to an uncommon association, a specific regional context, or contain a flaw, making it unanswerable with standard toxicological knowledge from the given options.

================================================================================
Question 267 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
State of involutional melancholia and consisting of statements that there is no world he does not exist . His body is dead etc refers to

Options:
  Confabulation
  Hypochondriacal delusion
  Illusion
✓ Nihilistic delusion
  Tactile hallucination

Explanation:
Nihilistic delusion is a type of delusion, often seen in severe depressive episodes (like involutional melancholia) or psychotic disorders, where the individual holds a false belief that they, a part of their body, or the world itself does not exist, is dead, or is coming to an end. The statements 'there is no world,' 'he does not exist,' and 'his body is dead' are classic examples.

================================================================================
Question 268 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Fracture along the head sutures is

Options:
✓ Hypothermia
  Dizziness
  Paralysis
  Pinpoint pupils

Explanation:
The question asks about a type of fracture ('along the head sutures'), but the provided options describe symptoms (hypothermia, dizziness, paralysis, pinpoint pupils). This is a clear mismatch between the question and the options, making it unanswerable as presented.

================================================================================
Question 269 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Drug addiction and drug abuse is the most common problem in which age group

Options:
  Childhood
✓ Adolescents
  Adulthood
  Old age
  No age restriction

Explanation:
Adolescence is a critical period for the initiation of drug use and the development of substance use disorders. Factors such as peer pressure, risk-taking behavior, and ongoing brain development make adolescents particularly vulnerable to drug addiction and abuse.

================================================================================
Question 270 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Alcohol , barbiturates and opiates are placed in category

Options:
  CNS stimulants
✓ CNS Depressent
  Inhalents
  Hallucinogens

Explanation:
Alcohol, barbiturates, and opiates (opioids) are all classified as central nervous system (CNS) depressants. They reduce brain activity, leading to effects such as sedation, anxiolysis, and respiratory depression.

================================================================================
Question 271 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15 years old boy who is running high grade fever for last 5 days presented to the emergency room for abnormal behaviour for last 8 hrs According to his mother he is irritable with disturb sleep and occasionally he become teriified by pereciving the ropes charpon as snake @.which one of the following is likely the condition he is suffering??

Options:
  Febrile fits
  Dementia
✓ Delirium
  Manic episode
  Panic attack

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with high-grade fever, abnormal behavior, irritability, disturbed sleep, and perceptual disturbances (misinterpreting ropes as snakes) are classic signs of delirium. Delirium is an acute and fluctuating disturbance in attention and cognition, often triggered by underlying medical conditions such as fever or infection.

================================================================================
Question 272 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
If student performing t test for the comparison of mean and p=O.0256 then

Options:
✓ We reject Ho and accept HI
  We accept Ho
  We reject HI
  We accept Ho and reject HI
  We cannot decide

Explanation:
When the p-value (0.0256) is less than the conventional significance level (alpha, typically 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis (Ho). Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (H1). Therefore, 'We reject Ho and accept H1' is the correct interpretation.

================================================================================
Question 273 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The fundamental statistical indicators used in normal standard curve are :

Options:
✓ Mean and standard deviation
  Median and standard deviation
  Median and mode
  Variance and median
  Variance and mode

Explanation:
The normal (Gaussian) distribution is fully characterized by two parameters: its mean (which determines the center of the curve) and its standard deviation (which determines the spread or width of the curve). These are the fundamental indicators.

================================================================================
Question 274 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The media of the series of numerical value :

Options:
  Equals to average
  Graph or chart
✓ A number
  A frequeecy table
  measure of uncertainity

Explanation:
The median (typo 'media') of a series of numerical values is a specific number that divides the ordered dataset into two equal halves. It is a single numerical value, not a graph, table, or measure of uncertainty.

================================================================================
Question 275 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
if the average of series of values is 10 and their variance is 4 then the co-efficeint of variation (ration of standard deviation/ average. is

Options:
✓ 200/0
  50/0

Explanation:
The coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated as (Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100%. Given: Mean = 10. Variance = 4. Standard Deviation (SD) = √Variance = √4 = 2. CV = (2 / 10) * 100% = 0.2 * 100% = 20%. None of the provided options (200% or 50%) match 20%.

================================================================================
Question 276 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
If a series of value consist of 21 numbers then for finding the media we order the values in ascending order and we use :

Options:
✓ The 11 value in ordered series
  The median b/w 10 and 11 value
  The median b/w 11 and 12 value
  The 10th value is in ordered series
  The difference b/w highest and lowest

Explanation:
When there is an odd number of data points (n), the median is the value at the position (n+1)/2 after ordering the data. For a series of 21 numbers, the median position is (21+1)/2 = 11. So, it is the 11th value in the ordered series.

================================================================================
Question 277 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The first quartal of a series of value is

Options:
  The value in the order series located at 25% of number of value in the series
  The value of order serie located 75%
✓ The numberic value for which a quarter a of series value are lower
  The numberic value for which a quarter a of series value are higher
  The value seperating 25 % of value from data set

Explanation:
The first quartile (Q1) is the numerical value below which 25% of the data falls. It can also be described as the value that separates the lowest 25% of the data from the upper 75% when the data is ordered.

================================================================================
Question 278 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Pearson corelation co-effiient denoted by small r measures :

Options:
  Scattering strength of data for statistical series
  The strength if correlation b/w mean and median
✓ The strength of correlation b/w 2 numerical parameters
  The tendancy of simultaneous inc or dec or inverse evaluation for 2 nominal parameters
  The tendancy to estimate one product value from another

Explanation:
Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative (numerical) variables. It indicates how closely the data points follow a straight line.

================================================================================
Question 279 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The correlation coefficient compute for Z parameter measured in 429 participants is r=O.829

Options:
  Parameters are directly correlated ,the link is weak,r is positive close 0
✓ 2 parameters are directly correlated link is strong is positive close to 1
  Inversely link ,link is strong ,r is negative close to 1
  Sample less than 30 so no correlation

Explanation:
A Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.829 indicates a strong positive linear correlation between the two parameters. Since r is positive (0.829), they are directly correlated (as one increases, the other tends to increase). Since 0.829 is close to 1, the link is strong.

================================================================================
Question 280 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The confidence interval for mean calculated for a series of values has the interpretation

Options:
✓ The true mean the one that aproximate the population mean is almost certain inside the confidence interval
  The true variance is almost certain inside the confidence interval
  The true median is almost certain inside the confidence interval
  It is an interval that contain almost all the values of the series
  Its spaculated value and need further investegtion

Explanation:
A confidence interval for the mean provides a range of values within which the true population mean is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%). It is an estimate of the population mean, not the sample mean or other parameters, and it is almost certain to contain the true population mean if the study were repeated many times.

================================================================================
Question 281 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The student's test is a

Options:
✓ Parametric test
  Non parametric test
  Test for comparing values
  Test for comparing variances
  Predictive test

Explanation:
Student's t-test is a parametric statistical test. Parametric tests make assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution (e.g., that the data is normally distributed, or that variances are equal). The t-test is specifically used to compare means.

================================================================================
Question 282 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The result of statistical test,denoted p ,shall b interpreted as follows

Options:
✓ Null hypothesis HO is rejected if p is less than 0.05
  Null hypothesis HO is rejected if p is greater than 0.05
  Alternated hypothesis HI is rejected if p is greater than 0.05
  Null hypothesis HO is not related to it
  Null hypothesis HO is accepted if p is greater thn 0.05

Explanation:
In hypothesis testing, the conventional rule is to reject the null hypothesis (Ho) if the p-value is less than the predetermined significance level (alpha), commonly 0.05. This indicates that the observed result is statistically significant and unlikely to have occurred by random chance.

================================================================================
Question 283 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An investigator inspects that use of acetaminophin in pregnancy increases the risk of neural tube defects.the risk of neural tube defect due to use of acetaminophen during pregnancy in whole population is 1:1000.what study design can be used for hypothesis

Options:
  Crossectional study
✓ Cohort study
  Clinical study
  Casecontrol study

Explanation:
To investigate whether the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy *increases the risk* (cause-effect relationship) of neural tube defects, a cohort study would be the most appropriate observational design. In a cohort study, pregnant women exposed to acetaminophen would be followed over time and compared to unexposed pregnant women to see the incidence of neural tube defects.

================================================================================
Question 284 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Epidemic occurring every 3 years is called ?

Options:
  Seasonal trend
✓ Cyclical trend
  Pandemic
  Alternate epidemic
  Secular pandemic

Explanation:
A cyclical trend in epidemiology refers to disease occurrences that increase and decrease over a period of several years, or more than a year. An epidemic occurring every 3 years fits this description, as it's a recurring pattern over a multi-year cycle.

================================================================================
Question 285 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In calculation of incidence denominator is

Options:
  Mid year population
  Total population
✓ Population at risk
  Healthy population
  Diseaesed population

Explanation:
The denominator for calculating incidence (the rate of new cases of disease) is the 'population at risk.' This includes only those individuals in the population who are susceptible to developing the disease and who do not already have it.

================================================================================
Question 286 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A study was conducted in which one group was women with infants with ntds using acetaminophen and others without neural tube defects also using acetaminophen.which measure of association is used ?

Options:
✓ Odds ratio
  Relative risk
  Attributable risk
  Privilance
  Hazard Ration

Explanation:
The study design described (one group with infants with neural tube defects (NTDs) and another group without NTDs, both questioned about acetaminophen use) is a case-control study. In case-control studies, the measure of association is the odds ratio (OR), which estimates how much more likely cases are to have been exposed than controls.

================================================================================

Question 288 (KGMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The purpose of double blind or double masked studies is to

Options:
  Achieve comparibikity of treated and untreated subjs
  Reduce the effects of sampling variation
✓ Avoid observe and subject biased
  Avoid observer biased and sampling variation
  Avoid confounding

Explanation:
The primary purpose of double-blinding (or double-masking) in clinical trials is to reduce bias. It prevents both the participants (subjects) and the researchers (observers/investigators) from knowing who is receiving the intervention versus the control, thereby minimizing the impact of expectations and unintentional differences in assessment or reporting.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Question:
Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is helpful for controlling

Options:
  Recall bias
  Non compliance
  Placebo effect
  Effect modification (interelation.
✓ Confounding

Explanation:
Randomization is a cornerstone of clinical trials. Its main purpose is to create comparable groups by distributing both known and unknown confounding factors equally between the intervention and control arms. This helps ensure that any observed differences in outcomes can be attributed to the intervention rather than to other factors.

Question:
Most common method of minimizing recall bias is to select:

Options:
  Healthy control group
  Disease control group
  Age match control group
  Sex match control group
✓ Control group from same base population which give rise to cases

Explanation:
Recall bias occurs when there are differences in the accuracy or completeness of remembering past exposures between cases and controls. To minimize this, selecting a control group from the same base population that gave rise to the cases is crucial, as this ensures that both groups are representative of the same underlying population and have similar likelihoods of accurately recalling past exposures.

  Cloudy/purrulent CSF
  lncreased intracranial pressure
  Neutrophils count 90,000/mm
  Proteins 700mg/dl
✓ Smear shows no bacteria on gram staining

Explanation:
Predisposing conditions for pyogenic meningitis include factors like immunosuppression, skull fractures, otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia. The options provided (a-d) are all *findings* or *consequences* of meningitis, not predisposing conditions. Option (e), 'Smear shows no bacteria on gram staining,' is also a laboratory finding and, furthermore, would be an unusual finding for *pyogenic* (bacterial) meningitis, where bacteria are typically seen unless antibiotics have already been administered. Thus, it is the least likely to be considered a predisposing condition among the choices.

================================================================================
Question 379 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:

Options:
  Anatomic anomalies
  Blood dyscrasias
  Neurosurgery
  Penetrating cranial trauma
✓ pyogenic extra neural infections

Explanation:
This question is flawed as all the provided options (anatomic anomalies, blood dyscrasias, neurosurgery, penetrating cranial trauma, and pyogenic extra neural infections) are well-known predisposing conditions for the development of a brain abscess. Since the question asks for what is *not* a predisposing condition, and all options *are* predisposing conditions, there is no correct answer among the choices. Pyogenic extra-neural infections (e.g., endocarditis, lung abscess, sinusitis) are a common source for hematogenous spread leading to brain abscess.

Astrocytes perform numerous vital functions in the CNS, including contributing to the blood-brain barrier, metabolic support, and reacting to injury (gliosis). However, demyelination of neurons is typically performed by oligodendrocytes in the CNS, not astrocytes. Demyelination is the process of stripping away the myelin sheath, not a normal function of astrocytes.

Options:
  Alzheimer disease
  Dementia disease
✓ Karsakoffls psychosis
  Organic psychosis
  Senile dementia

Explanation:
The clinical picture of a chronic alcoholic patient presenting with confusion, severe memory impairment (no remembrance of belongings, unaware of wellbeing), and signs of nutritional deficiencies is highly suggestive of Korsakoff's psychosis. This condition is a chronic memory disorder caused by severe thiamine deficiency, often associated with chronic alcoholism, and frequently follows an episode of Wernicke's encephalopathy.

Question 386 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 23-years-old female was brought by her brother to medical emergency with lower limbs weakness for last 3 days. She had also pain and numbness in lower limbs. She was also complaining of retention of urine for last 1 day. Her upper limbs were completely normal, Clinical examination showed signs of upper motor neuron lesion in lower limbs and sensory level at T4. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Guillen Barre syndrome
  Multiple sclerosis
  Poliomyelitis
  Pott's disease
✓ Transverse myelitis

Explanation:
The rapid onset of lower limb weakness, pain, numbness, urinary retention, upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs, and a distinct sensory level (T4) suggests an acute inflammatory lesion affecting the spinal cord. This constellation of symptoms is characteristic of acute transverse myelitis. The sparing of upper limbs and the presence of a sensory level differentiate it from Guillain-Barré Syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 387 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40-years-old female presented with one year history of "on and off blurring of vision on hot summer days. Now she is complaining of pins and needle sensations In the right hand and weakness of the left leg for the past 03 days, What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  lschemic stroke
✓ Multiple sclerosis
  Pituitary tumor
  Transverse myelitis
  Cervical cord myelopathy

Explanation:
The relapsing-remitting nature of symptoms ('on and off'), exacerbation of symptoms by heat ('Uhthoff's phenomenon' - blurring vision on hot summer days), and the development of new neurological deficits (pins and needles, leg weakness) disseminated in space and time, are highly characteristic of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

================================================================================
Question 388 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Ataxia is due to dysfunction of the:

Options:
  Cerebellum only
✓ Cereb ellum and it's sensory pathways in the posterior columns of the spinal cord or a combination of these.
  Cerebral cortex and it's sensory pathways in the posterior columns of the spinal cord or a combination of these.
  Sensory pathways in the posterior columns of the spinal cord
  Cerebellum cerebral cortex and it's sensory pathways in the posterior columns of the spinal cord, or a combination of these.

Explanation:
Ataxia, defined as a lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements, primarily results from dysfunction of the cerebellum. However, it can also be caused by disruption of the sensory pathways in the posterior columns of the spinal cord (sensory ataxia), or a combination of both cerebellar and sensory pathway involvement.

================================================================================
Question 389 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 3 year old male child is seen in the OPD with history of repeated infections and 'failure to thrive. On examination he is underweight, febrile with unsteady gait.His eye examination reveals reddish spots over the sclera. His elder brother died at the age of 8 years due to repeated infections. The most likely diagnosis is?

Options:
  Acute cerebellar ataxia
  Acute cerebellitis
✓ Ataxia telangiectasia
  Cerebellar tumor
  Friedreich ataxia

Explanation:
The clinical picture of progressive ataxia (unsteady gait), recurrent infections (immunodeficiency), oculocutaneous telangiectasias (reddish spots over the sclera), and a family history of early death from infections strongly points to Ataxia-telangiectasia. This is a rare, autosomal recessive, multisystem disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, immunodeficiency, and oculocutaneous telangiectasias.

================================================================================
Question 390 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which statemenet concerning the use of Lithium in Bipolar affective disorder accurate?

Options:
  Excessive take of Nacl increases the lithium toxicity
  Lithium allieviates the manic phase of bipolar disorder within 24 hrs
  It does not cross the placental barrier
✓ Its dosage must be decreased in patients taking thiazides
  Its elimination rate is equivalent to creatinine.

Explanation:
Thiazide diuretics reduce the renal clearance of lithium, leading to increased serum lithium levels and a higher risk of toxicity. Therefore, the lithium dosage must be decreased in patients taking thiazides. Excessive intake of NaCl decreases lithium toxicity (by increasing its excretion), and lithium's onset of action for mania is typically several days, not 24 hours. Lithium does cross the placental barrier, and its elimination is primarily renal but not exactly equivalent to creatinine clearance for dosage adjustment purposes.

================================================================================
Question 391 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with undiagnosed coronary artery disease is given a medication shortly after that she develops intense tight and "crushing dis comforr" Of her chest, An ekg reveal ST segment changes indicats Acute myocardial ischemia, patient suffering Angina pectoris as a result of a drug . Which drug most likely is used.

Options:
  Clozapine
  Pentazocine
  Phenytoin
✓ Sumatriptan
  Zolpidam

Explanation:
Sumatriptan is a serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist used for acute migraine treatment. Its vasoconstrictive effects, particularly on coronary arteries, can lead to angina, myocardial ischemia, and even myocardial infarction, especially in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. Therefore, sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease.

================================================================================

Question:
Which opioid analgesic is used as transdermal patch to relieve severe pain of malignancy

Options:
✓ Busprione
  Chlordizepoxide
  Chloral hydrate
  Midazolam
  Zolpidem

Explanation:
The question asks for an opioid analgesic used as a transdermal patch for severe malignancy pain. Fentanyl is a potent opioid commonly administered via a transdermal patch for chronic severe pain, particularly in cancer patients. Buprenorphine also comes in a transdermal patch. None of the listed options (Buspirone, Chlordiazepoxide, Chloral hydrate, Midazolam, Zolpidem) are opioid analgesics; they are anxiolytics/sedative-hypnotics. Therefore, based on the provided options, there is no correct answer to this question.

================================================================================
Question 394 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient after taking certain medicine reports profound thirst and dilute urine everyday. This is the adverse effect of which drug?

Options:
  Diazepam
  Flouxetine
  Haloperidol
✓ Lithium
  Phenytoin

Explanation:
Profound thirst (polydipsia) and dilute urine (polyuria) are classic symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a well-known adverse effect of chronic lithium therapy. Lithium impairs the kidney's ability to concentrate urine by reducing the response of the collecting ducts to antidiuretic hormone (ADH).

================================================================================

A patient has piloerection, mydriasis, high blood pressure, and abdominal cramps, your diagnosis is :

Options:
  Alcohol Abstinence
  Barbiturates abstinence
  Benzodiazapines abstinence
✓ Opiod abstinence
  Amphetamines abstinence

Explanation:
Piloerection ('goosebumps'), mydriasis (dilated pupils), high blood pressure, and abdominal cramps are classic signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (abstinence syndrome). These are due to overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and unmasking of pain pathways.

================================================================================
Question 397 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 33 years old woman has a 15 years history of Alcohol abuse . She comes to the emergency dept for the treatment of injuries she has received during a fall. She says she has been drinking heaviky and almost continuously for almost 2 weeks. She wants to stop, which drug would effectively and safely lessen her withdrawal symptoms

Options:
✓ Morphine
  Pentazocine
  Fentanyl
  Tramadol
  Lignocaine

Explanation:
The appropriate and safest medication to lessen alcohol withdrawal symptoms is typically a benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide), which acts on GABA receptors. The options provided (Morphine, Pentazocine, Fentanyl, Tramadol - all opioids; Lignocaine - a local anesthetic) are not indicated for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and could be harmful, potentially exacerbating central nervous system depression if there's residual alcohol or interacting poorly. Thus, none of the given options are correct for managing alcohol withdrawal.

================================================================================
Question 398 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
CNS stimulation produces by methyxanthine is due to antagonism of receptors

Options:
✓ Gaba receptors
  Gylcine
  Muscurinic
  Acyltacholine

Explanation:
Methylxanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, exert their central nervous system stimulant effects primarily through antagonism of adenosine receptors. They also inhibit phosphodiesterase, leading to increased cAMP levels. None of the provided options (GABA, Glycine, Muscarinic, Acetylcholine) are adenosine receptors, making all the options incorrect for the mechanism of action described.

================================================================================
Question 399 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42 years old man with a history of alcholism is brought to the emergency room in a confused and delirious state. He has truncal ataxia ans opthalmoplegia. The most approperiate and immediate course of action is :

Options:
✓ Chlordizepoxide

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with confusion, delirium, truncal ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia is highly indicative of Wernicke's encephalopathy, an acute thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency, typically seen in alcoholics. The most appropriate and immediate course of action for Wernicke's encephalopathy is the administration of intravenous thiamine. While chlordiazepoxide (a benzodiazepine) is used to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms like delirium and agitation, it does not address the underlying thiamine deficiency. However, given that chlordiazepoxide is the only provided option, it would be used to manage the delirium and prevent seizures, but thiamine remains critical.

================================================================================
Question 400 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Ultra short acting barbiturates after IV administeration are quickly redistributed and on chemical analysis are more likely to be detected in

Options:
  Bile
✓ Body fats
  Bone
  Muscles
  Skin

Explanation:
Ultra-short-acting barbiturates (e.g., thiopental) are highly lipid-soluble. After intravenous administration, they rapidly redistribute from the central compartment (brain) to highly perfused tissues, and then quickly to less perfused, but large volume, lipid-rich tissues like body fat. This rapid redistribution into fat and muscle accounts for their short duration of action in the brain and why they can be detected in fat stores for longer periods.

================================================================================
Question 401 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Barbiturates are excreted chiefly in

Options:
  Blood
  Bile
  Gastric content
✓ Urine
  Viterous humor

Explanation:
Barbiturates, primarily after being metabolized in the liver, are then largely excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine by the kidneys.

================================================================================

Options:
  Aripiprazole
  Risperidone
  Clonazpine
✓ Sertriline
  Escitalopram

Explanation:
The symptoms described (extensive checking of locks, irrational thoughts, feeling helpless in resisting) are characteristic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), with compulsive checking behaviors. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline (Sertriline) and escitalopram are first-line pharmacological treatments for OCD. Both are good choices from the options, with Sertraline being a very common first-line agent.

Options:
  Vaplroic acid
  Setralin
✓ Respiradone
  Amyline

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of delusions (family plotting against him), auditory hallucinations (hearing voices from the basement), social withdrawal, reduced sleep, and self-neglect are highly indicative of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia. Risperidone (Respiradone) is an atypical antipsychotic and a common first-line choice for managing psychotic symptoms.

================================================================================

Combining MAO inhibitors with SSRIs (or other serotonergic drugs) is contraindicated due to the severe risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities.

================================================================================
Question 410 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old male patient is diagnosed with major depressive disorder and is prescribed amitriptyline. He takes the medication as prescribed for several weeks and report improvement in his mood and energy levels. What is the mechanism of action of amitriptyline in treating depression?

Options:
  It inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine
  It blocks the receptor sites of dopamine
  It increases the production of dopamine
✓ It inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepineohrine
  It increases the production of serotonin

Explanation:
Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that primarily works by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing the availability of these neurotransmitters in the brain and alleviating depressive symptoms.

================================================================================
Question 411 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 years old patient presented with bradykinesia, resting tremor and cog wheel rigidity. He is on levodopa. Peripheral adverse effects of levodopa includes nausea, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. These adverse effects can be deminished by additional administration of which drug?

Options:
  Amantadine
  Bromocriptine
✓ Carbidopa
  Entacapone
  Tolcapone

Explanation:
Carbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. When administered with levodopa, it inhibits the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain. This reduces the peripheral side effects of levodopa, such as nausea, vomiting, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias, without reducing its central efficacy.

================================================================================
Question 412 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:

Options:
  Bradycardia
  Bradycardia and hypertension
  Bradycardia and hypotension
✓ Tachycardia and hypertension
  Tachycardia and hypotension

Explanation:
Epinephrine (adrenaline) is a vasoconstrictor often added to local anesthetics to prolong their duration of action and reduce systemic absorption. However, in patients with cardiovascular disease (hypertension, coronary artery disease), the systemic absorption of epinephrine can cause adverse cardiovascular effects, including tachycardia and hypertension, which could be dangerous in this patient.

================================================================================

Options:
  Mesocortical 'tract
  Mesolimbic tract
✓ Nigrostriatal tract
  Reticulospinal tract
  Tuberoinfundibular tract

Explanation:
Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, blocks dopamine D2 receptors. Haloperidol-induced Parkinsonism (extrapyramidal symptoms) is a direct consequence of dopamine receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for motor control.

================================================================================
Question 416 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old woman is diagnosed with schizophrenia and prescribed haloperidol. The therapeutic effect of haloperidol is mediated, at least in part by it's blockade of which of the following receptors?

Options:
  Alpha adrenoreceptors
  Beta adrenoreceptors
✓ Dopamine D2 receptors
  Histamine HI receptors
  Muscarinic receptors

Explanation:
The therapeutic antipsychotic effect of typical antipsychotics like haloperidol is primarily mediated by their antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain.

Options:
  It blocks reuptake of serotonin
  It is a 5-HTIA agonist
✓ It is a 5-HTID agonist
  It is a 5-HT3 antagonist
  It is a 5-HT2A antagonist

Explanation:
Sumatriptan is a triptan drug, and its primary mechanism of action in treating migraine is by acting as an agonist at serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. This leads to vasoconstriction of dilated intracranial blood vessels and inhibition of neuropeptide release from trigeminal nerve endings.

================================================================================
Question 419 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 42 years old man complained to his doctor about increasing anxiety, insomnia, irritability and severe craving for cigarettes. The patient, who was a two pack a day smoker for 15 years, had recently quit smoking. The physician prescribed which of the following drug to relieve his symptoms?

Options:
  Bromocriptine
  Bromazepam
  Buprenorphine
✓ Bupropion
  Buspirone

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, irritability, severe craving for cigarettes) are classic for nicotine withdrawal after quitting smoking. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is also approved as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation, effectively reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

================================================================================
Question 420 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 18 years old boy who had never previously used recreational drugs, took one tablet of LSD at a party. The CNS effects of this drug are primarily related to the activation of which of the following receptors?

Options:
  Allergic
  Muscarinic
  Nicotinic
  Noradrenergic
✓ Serotoninergic

Explanation:
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent hallucinogen whose central nervous system effects are primarily mediated by its partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.

Options:
  Amphetamine
  Cocaine
  Diazepam
✓ Heroin
  LSD

Explanation:
The classic triad of opioid overdose (such as from heroin) includes central nervous system depression (unconsciousness, oversedation), respiratory depression (respiratory rate 5/min, cyanosis), and pinpoint pupils (miosis). The other drugs listed typically cause different presentations (e.g., stimulants like amphetamine/cocaine cause sympathetic activation, benzodiazepines cause sedation but less severe respiratory depression usually).

================================================================================
Question 422 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 72 years old man presented to the OPD with a loss of balance and frequent falls for the past one month. The patient has a masked face, difficulty in initiating movement and tremors in hand which disappear while ask to lift a pen. Which of the following is the drug of choice for this patient?

Options:
  Benztropine
  Fluoxetine
✓ Levodopa
  Propranolol
  Risperidone

Explanation:
The symptoms of a masked face, difficulty initiating movement (bradykinesia/akinesia), resting tremor (disappearing with intentional movement), loss of balance, and frequent falls are classic for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa (combined with carbidopa) is the most effective medication for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease, particularly for bradykinesia and rigidity.

Question 423 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 69-year-old woman presented to the OPD with Parkinson's disease and put on primary therapy along with disjunctive therapy for severe symptoms. She had a chronic history of depression and had been on Imipramine for the last 5 years. The next day she presented to the ER with anxiety, restlessness, delirium, diaphoresis, myoclonus, hypertension and hyperthermia. Which adjunctive therapy could have contributed to these sign and symptoms?

Options:
  Amantadine
  Bromocriptine
  Entacapone
  Pramipexole
✓ Selegiline

Explanation:
The symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, delirium, diaphoresis, myoclonus, hypertension, and hyperthermia, resembling serotonin syndrome, are a severe adverse drug interaction. Selegiline is a selective MAO-B inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which also increases serotonin levels. Combining an MAO inhibitor (even selective MAO-B at higher doses) with a TCA can lead to serotonin syndrome due to excessive serotonergic activity.

================================================================================
Question 424 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 56 years old woman who is a diagnosed case of hypertension, presented to medical OPD for her routine checkup. While looking at her previous record, it was found that she was using lithium carbonate. Lithium is usually used for which of the following condition?

Options:
  Anxiety disorder
✓ Bipolar affective disorder
  Depression
  Obsessive compulsive disorder
  Petit Mal seizures

Explanation:
Lithium carbonate is a classic and highly effective mood stabilizer primarily used in the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar affective disorder, particularly for manic and mixed episodes.

Question 425 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
4 38-year-old heroin addict was determined to quit the habit and was admitted to a detoxification clinic. after physical examination and laboratory tests, treatment was started. Sub lingual administration of which of the following drugs would be most appropriate for this patient?

Options:
✓ Buprenorphine
  Codeine
  Diazepam
  Naltrexone
  Phenobarbital

Explanation:
Buprenorphine (often in combination with naloxone, as Suboxone) is an opioid partial agonist that is commonly used for opioid substitution therapy (detoxification and maintenance treatment) in opioid dependence. Its sublingual administration is effective and provides a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, making it safer than full agonists.

================================================================================
Question 426 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40- years old man has low mood, anhedonla, lack of energy with death wishes, suicidal ideations and has made plans to commit suicide. He has history of serious suicide attempts in the past as well. Currently his only Intake has decreased markedly and not interacting with people. He does not respond to medications despite good compliance. What is the best next strategy of management In this case?

Options:
  Addition of lithium with anti depressants
  Augmentation with anti psychotic medications
  Cognitive behavior therapy
  Continue on the same treatment
✓ Electroconvulsive therapy

Explanation:
In a patient with severe, treatment-resistant depression, especially with suicidal ideation, psychotic features, or severe functional impairment (decreased intake, social withdrawal), and who has not responded to adequate trials of medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often considered the most effective and rapidly acting treatment option.

================================================================================
Question 427 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
pre-anesthetic medication is given to:

Options:
  To control patient co morbidity
  To decrease duration of surgery
  To decrease pain during surgery
  To maintain blood pressure
✓ To make anesthetic procedure pleasant and safe

Explanation:
Pre-anesthetic medications are administered to achieve several goals, including reducing anxiety, providing sedation, preventing nausea and vomiting, reducing pain, and minimizing autonomic reflexes. The overarching aim is to make the anesthetic procedure more pleasant and safer for the patient.

================================================================================
Question 428 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old chronic alcoholic man presented in OPD with the consequences of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, leading to dementia and memory disorders in alcohol abuse. Which of the following syndromes is most likely present in this patient?

Options:
  Fitz hugh curtis syndrome
  Helmert syndrome
  Huynh-Feldt syndrome
✓ Korsakoff's syndrome
  Smirnoff's syndrome

Explanation:
Korsakoff's syndrome is a chronic memory disorder predominantly seen in chronic alcoholics due to severe thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. It is characterized by profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia, confabulation, and often progresses to a form of alcohol-related dementia.

================================================================================
Question 429 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young male patient was brought to the emergency room suffering from an overdose of cocaine following intravenous administration. Which of the following is unlikely to be present in this patient?

Options:
  Agitation
✓ Bradycardia
  Hyperthermia
  Myocardial infarction
  Seizures

Explanation:
Cocaine is a powerful central nervous system stimulant that causes significant sympathetic activation. An overdose typically leads to symptoms like agitation, tachycardia (increased heart rate), hypertension, hyperthermia, and can result in serious cardiovascular complications like myocardial infarction and arrhythmias, as well as seizures. Bradycardia (slow heart rate) is highly unlikely in acute cocaine overdose; tachycardia is the expected finding.

================================================================================
Question 430 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A person who was given a barbiturate overdose, experienced giddiness, ataxia, slurred speech, delirium, and excitement, but as the poisoning progressed, the person became hypotensive, hypothermic, and cyanotlc, with an abnormal breathing pattern. In the advanced stages of barbiturates poisoning. what form of abnormal respiratory pattern is commonly seen?

Options:
  Biots breathing
✓ chyne stokes breathing
  Apneustic breathing
  hyperpnea breathing
  kussmaul breathing

Explanation:
In severe central nervous system depressant poisoning, such as from barbiturates, the brainstem respiratory centers are profoundly affected. Cheyne-Stokes breathing (typo 'chyne stokes breathing'), characterized by a cyclical pattern of waxing and waning respiration interspersed with periods of apnea, is a classic abnormal respiratory pattern seen in deep coma and brainstem dysfunction.

================================================================================
Question 431 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A woman with many comorblditles leads a stressful life that disrupts her sleep. To get some restful sleep,she decided to take choral Ihydrate as a hypnotic. She overdosed on Choral Hydrate since she was unaware of the dosage. Her attendants rushed her to the emergency room, where she was given a stornach wash. What should be used for choral hydrate stomach washing?

Options:
  Alkali
  charcoal powder
✓ Potassium permanganate
  Saline washing
  Sodium bicarbonate

Explanation:
For chloral hydrate (typo 'choral Ihydrate') overdose, gastric lavage with potassium permanganate (a strong oxidizing agent) has historically been used to oxidize and inactivate chloral hydrate and its active metabolites, preventing further absorption. Activated charcoal is also often indicated, but was not among the options.

================================================================================
Question 432 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A person with severe withdrawal from reality and living as if in another world, a world of fantasy with delusions and hallucinations accepts all symptoms as real. reconstructs an environment of his own with which he tries to recreate the world. What type of psychiatric disorder he is suffering from?

Options:
  Delirium
  Delusion
  Psychopath
✓ Psychosis
  Sociopath

Explanation:
Psychosis is a severe mental disorder characterized by a significant break from reality. Key features include delusions (false, fixed beliefs) and hallucinations (perceiving things that are not there), leading the individual to experience and often construct an alternative reality. The description of severe withdrawal from reality and accepting symptoms as real is indicative of a psychotic state.

================================================================================
Question 433 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A Hashish addict after killing several persons surrendered himself to police. According to him they all were his enemy and was planning to kill him. What is this condition called?

Options:
  Bad trip
  Delirium tremens
  Magnans symptoms
✓ Run amok
  Speed ball

Explanation:
The term 'run amok' describes a state of sudden, frenzied, and indiscriminate violent behavior, often stemming from paranoid or persecutory delusions (e.g., believing others are enemies plotting to kill him), and can be associated with substance-induced psychosis, as seen with hashish use.

================================================================================
Question 434 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Provision of guidance, education, rehablitation after care and preventive measures in the community (Family, home, workplace or educational institutions etc.). comes under which section of mental health act?

Options:
✓ Section 7
  Section 8
  Section 9
  Section 10
  Section 11

Explanation:
This question refers to a specific section of a Mental Health Act. The section numbers for provisions related to community care, rehabilitation, and preventive measures vary significantly between different mental health legislations across countries and even within different regions of a country. Without knowing which specific Mental Health Act (e.g., Pakistan's Mental Health Ordinance, UK's Mental Health Act, etc.) is being referred to, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

================================================================================
Question 435 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A person after kiling a man stated that he was a bear completely denying the actual physical state of the person he killed. However, the court subjected him to be responsible for the crime. What is this condition called?

Options:
  Delirium
✓ Delusion
  Hallucinations
  lllusion
  Psychosis

Explanation:
A delusion is a false, fixed belief that is firmly held despite clear evidence to the contrary and is not shared by others in the individual's cultural group. The person's belief that the man he killed was a bear, despite reality, is a clear example of a delusion.

================================================================================
Question 436 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young male was brought to the emergency department with pin point pupil, moist, perspiring skin and peculiar alcoholic smell, which of the towline i characteristics breathing pattern recorded in the said poisoning?

Options:
✓ Slow breathing
  Fast absent breathing
  Fast slow breathing
  Slow fast breathing
  Fast breathing

Explanation:
Pinpoint pupils and a moist, perspiring skin, coupled with a peculiar alcoholic smell (which could indicate a co-ingestion or a less common alcohol toxicity) and over-sedation, point strongly towards an opioid overdose or possibly severe organophosphate poisoning. In either case, severe central nervous system depression leads to respiratory depression, typically characterized by slow and shallow breathing.

================================================================================
Question 437 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young cherubic male was autopsied In the Department of Forensic Medicine, KMC, Peshawar. lheAton indings revealed, non-specific asphyxia signs, cyanosed face, and froth from mouth/n&se with Intense black PM Lividity. Which tyne of poisoning Is this?

Options:
  Amitriptyline
  Amphetamines
  Belladonna
  Dhatura
✓ Oplum

Explanation:
The autopsy findings of non-specific asphyxia signs, cyanosed face, froth from the mouth/nose (indicating pulmonary edema), and intense black post-mortem lividity are highly suggestive of opioid (opium) overdose. Opioids cause severe respiratory depression leading to profound hypoxemia, which results in dark venous blood and intense lividity, often accompanied by pulmonary edema.

================================================================================
Question 438 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A traveler was swimming on the beach after one hour of twinning. there is sudden muscular ,pain, stiffness of neck and limb griddle, What Is the cause?

Options:
  Elepids
  Octopus
✓ Sea snake
  Stingray
  Vipers

Explanation:
Sea snake envenomation is characterized by a latent period (often 30 minutes to a few hours) following the bite, after which symptoms of muscle pain, weakness, and stiffness (including the neck and limb girdle) develop due to the neurotoxic and myotoxic components of the venom.

================================================================================
Question 439 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A person feels that grains of sand are lying under the skin or some small insects are creeping on the skin giving rise to itching sensation; which poisoning is responsible for this condition?

Options:
  Alcohol withdrawal
✓ Cocaine poisoning
  LSD
  Morphine poisoning
  Organophosphorus

Explanation:
The sensation of insects crawling under or on the skin, known as formication, is a classic tactile hallucination associated with chronic cocaine abuse or acute cocaine intoxication, often referred to as 'cocaine bugs.' It is accompanied by intense itching.

================================================================================
Question 440 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following is not partof Mc. Naughton Rule. which defines the circumstances in which the accused will not be held legally responsible for his conduct?

Options:
  Defect of reason
  Knowledge the act was wrong
  Nature of act
✓ Negligence
  Quality of act

Explanation:
The M'Naghten Rules (typo 'Mc. Naughton Rule') are a legal test for criminal insanity based on whether the accused, due to a 'defect of reason' from a 'disease of the mind,' did not know the 'nature and quality of the act' or did not know that what they were doing was 'wrong.' Negligence, which refers to a failure to exercise reasonable care, is not a component of the M'Naghten Rules for an insanity defense.

================================================================================
Question 441 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28- year- old male was brought to emergency department in semiconductor His pupils were constricted and respirator rate was 12 breathe per minute. A hand written note Was found in his room full of life's miseries.what is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Alcohol intoxication
  Amphetamines withdrawal
  Benzodiazepine overdose
✓ Suicide attempt with opioid
  Tryclic overdose

Explanation:
The combination of depressed mental status (semicomatose), constricted pupils (miosis), and respiratory depression (rate 12 breaths/min) is the classic triad of opioid overdose. The presence of a suicide note further supports an intentional overdose, making a suicide attempt with opioids the most likely diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 442 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the antidote in case of benzodiazepine overdose?

Options:
  Acetyl cysteine
  Disulfiram
✓ Flumazenil
  Naloxone
  Naltrexone

Explanation:
Flumazenil is a specific competitive antagonist at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA-A receptor complex. It is used as an antidote to rapidly reverse the central nervous system depressant effects of benzodiazepine overdose.

================================================================================
Question 443 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Twenty people were having liver carcinoma and medical record confirmed a past history of chronic hepatitis infection in 18 of these individuals. What is the Attributable Risk of developing liver carcinoma in people with a history of chronic hepatitis infection?

Options:
  2/18
  16/18
  18/2
✓ 18/20
  20/18

Explanation:
Attributable risk (or attributable proportion) in exposed individuals measures the proportion of disease incidence in the exposed group that is attributable to the exposure. If 18 out of 20 people with liver carcinoma had chronic hepatitis, then 18/20 represents the proportion of cases among those with the disease that are attributable to that exposure. It is often expressed as (Incidence in exposed - Incidence in unexposed) / Incidence in exposed, or simply the proportion of cases with the exposure if the exposure is considered causative among cases. In this context, if 18 out of 20 liver carcinoma cases had chronic hepatitis, the fraction 18/20 represents the proportion of these cases linked to the exposure.

================================================================================
Question 444 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The soldiers of Gulf war were observed from April 1991 till July 2002, while 50,000 troops who served elsewhere during the same period were also observed for the occurrence of cancers. What is the epidemiological study design in this scenario?

Options:
  Case control study
✓ Cohort study
  Cross sectional study
  Quasi experimental study
  Randomized control trial

Explanation:
This is a cohort study. Two groups (cohorts) are identified based on their exposure status (Gulf War service vs. served elsewhere). Both groups are followed forward in time (from 1991 to 2002) to observe the incidence of an outcome (occurrence of cancers). This is a classical design for assessing the risk associated with an exposure.

================================================================================
Question 445 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A public health expert wants to study the load of hypertension in Abbottabad district to establish special screening and treatment services. Which study design is more useful for this?

Options:
  Case control study
  Case report
  Cohort study
✓ Cross sectional study
  Experimental study

Explanation:
To understand the 'load' (prevalence) of hypertension in a district at a specific time, a cross-sectional study is the most useful design. This type of study assesses the presence of disease and other characteristics in a population at a single point in time, providing prevalence estimates crucial for planning screening and treatment services.

================================================================================
Question 446 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A sample of 100 men showed mean blood urea levels of x= 20 mg/dl and one (1)Standard deviation of 5 mg/dl. What is the probability that the population mean 'u' will be between 10 and 30?

Options:
  O.16
  O.20
  o.50
  O.68
✓ o.95

Explanation:
For a normally distributed sample, the probability that the population mean (μ) falls within a certain range can be estimated using the empirical rule if the range corresponds to standard deviations from the sample mean. If the sample mean is 20 and the standard deviation is 5, then a range of 10 to 30 represents two standard deviations on either side of the mean (20 ± 2*5 = 20 ± 10, i.e., 10 to 30). In a normal distribution, approximately 95% (specifically 95.4%) of values fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, the probability that the population mean will be between 10 and 30 is approximately 0.95 or 95%.

================================================================================
Question 447 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
ln a chi-square test, the observed and expected values are related by which of the following fact?

Options:
  Each ration observed
  No expected can equal an observed
  Each ration observed less than 1
  Each ratio observed greater than 1
✓ Their sums must be equal

Explanation:
In a chi-square test, the sum of the observed frequencies and the sum of the expected frequencies must always be equal. This is a fundamental property for the calculation of the chi-square statistic, as the expected frequencies are calculated to match the marginal totals of the observed data.

================================================================================
Question 448 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
in a standard statistical test, what is the hypothesis being tasted called?

Options:
  Alternative hypothesis
✓ Null hypothesis
  Research hypothesis
  Test hypothesis
  Wrong hypothesis

Explanation:
In a standard statistical test, the hypothesis that is initially assumed to be true and is subject to statistical testing is called the null hypothesis (Ho). It usually states that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables.

================================================================================
Question 449 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
If after performing a student t test for comparison of means, we obtain pO.0256,which of the following statement about hypothesis testing Is correct?

Options:
  We accept HO
  We cannot decide
✓ We reject Ho and accept HI
  We reject HI
  We accept HI

Explanation:
If the p-value (0.0256) obtained from a statistical test is less than the conventional significance level (alpha, typically 0.05), then we reject the null hypothesis (Ho). Rejecting Ho implies that there is statistically significant evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (H1).

================================================================================
Question 450 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A study was done over 1000 individuals to establish the relationship between high coffee consumption and gastritis. The correlation coefficient computed for the two parameters was "0.829. What does this show?

Options:
  There is no association between the two parameters
  The two parameters are directly correlated and the link is weak
✓ The link is strong
  Parameters are inversely and the link is strong
  Parameters are inversely and the link is weak

Explanation:
A correlation coefficient (r) of +0.829 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between high coffee consumption and gastritis. A value of r close to +1 (like 0.829) signifies a strong direct (positive) correlation, meaning as one variable increases, the other tends to increase significantly.

================================================================================
Question 451 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher wants to know about the Blood hemoglobin levels of school going children and compares it with normal hemoglobin levels. The population standard deviation is not known although data follows normal distribution. For obtaining P-value to see any statistical significance, which of the following statistical test will be applied?

Options:
  Chi square test
  One sample paired sample t-test
✓ One sample unpaired t-test
  Two sample t test
  Z test

Explanation:
To compare the mean hemoglobin level of a single sample of school-going children to a known (or hypothesized) normal population mean when the population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample data is normally distributed, a one-sample t-test (unpaired) is the appropriate statistical test. The z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is very large.

================================================================================
Question 452 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A sample of 160 urban and 150 rural women were randomly surveyed and asked about their practice of contraception in relation to education level. The data obtained is summarized in the following table. What will be the most appropriate test to accept or reject the null hypothesis in this case?

Options:
✓ Chi square test
  One sample paired sample t-test
  One sample unpaired t-test
  Two sample t test
  Z test

Explanation:
To assess the association or difference between two or more categorical variables (e.g., urban/rural status, contraception practice, and education level, all of which can be grouped into categories), the Chi-square test is the most appropriate statistical test. It examines whether the observed frequencies in the categories differ significantly from what would be expected by chance.

================================================================================
Question 453 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An analysis of the race of patients who visit an emergency room reveals that 40% are white, 25% are black 20% are Native American, and 15% are Asian. Which of the following graph is best suitable to depict this data?

Options:
  Histogram
  Normal curve
✓ Pie chart
  Scatter plot
  Venn diagram

Explanation:
A pie chart is the most suitable graphical representation for displaying the proportional distribution of categorical data that represent parts of a whole (e.g., the percentage breakdown of different racial groups in a population).

================================================================================
Question 454 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
1n a class of 100 medical students, the mean systolic blood pressure was found to be 126 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 6 mm Hg If the blood pressures in this sample are normally distributed, what portion of the medical students will have systolic blood pressures above 132 mm Hg?

Options:
  O.50/0
  2.50/0
  5%
✓ 160/0
  320/0

Explanation:
To find the portion of students with systolic blood pressure above 132 mmHg, we calculate the Z-score: Z = (X - Mean) / Standard Deviation = (132 - 126) / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1. A Z-score of 1 means the value is 1 standard deviation above the mean. In a normal distribution, approximately 15.87% (or roughly 16%) of the data falls above +1 standard deviation. Therefore, 16% is the closest answer.

================================================================================
Question 455 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
ln stratified sampling after identifying different strata, which of the following sampling technique can be used to include subjects in the sample?

Options:
  Consecutive
  Convenience
  Purposive
✓ Simple random
  Multistage

Explanation:
In stratified sampling, after dividing the population into strata (subgroups), a simple random sampling (or systematic random sampling) procedure is then applied *within each stratum* to select the final subjects for the sample. This ensures that each stratum is proportionately represented.

================================================================================
Question 456 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A study was done to find the prevalence of smoking to medical students. The researcher found some bias In his results which he attributed to the sampling technique, Which of the following technique he might Use?

Options:
  Cluster sampling
  Multistage sampling
  Simple random sampling
  Stratified sampling
✓ Systematic sampling

Explanation:
If a researcher found bias due to the sampling technique when studying the prevalence of smoking among medical students, it implies that the sampling method might have introduced a systematic error. Systematic sampling (e.g., selecting every nth person from a list) can introduce bias if there's a pattern in the list that aligns with the sampling interval (e.g., if every 10th student has a specific characteristic related to smoking), or if the starting point isn't truly random or if the list itself is not random.

================================================================================
Question 457 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A growth chart was displayed to trainees of pediatrics showing Growth of 24 months old babies, between RSth and 75th percentile, what is this statistical term known as?

Options:
  Confidence interval
✓ lnter quartile range
  Percentile
  Standard deviation
  Variance

Explanation:
The Interquartile Range (IQR) is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of a dataset. It represents the middle 50% of the data and is a measure of statistical dispersion. Showing growth between the 25th and 75th percentile directly refers to this range.

================================================================================
Question 458 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
crude rates are easy to calculate and consist of crude birth rates and crude death rates. what will be the denominator for calculation of crude birth rate?

Options:
  Birth rate minus death rates
✓ Mid year population
  Number of live births in area
  population at risk
  total births in the area

Explanation:
The crude birth rate is calculated by dividing the total number of live births in a specified period by the total mid-year population of that area, multiplied by a constant (usually 1000). The mid-year population is used as a proxy for the average population at risk during the year.

================================================================================
Question 459 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
1n an outbreak of food poisoning in a union council of 3500 population, 30 cases of food poisoning had occurred after attending a wedding ceremony with 6 deaths. what is the case fatality rate in the scenario?

Options:
  100/0
✓ 200/0
  300/0
  400/0
  500/0

Explanation:
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is calculated as (Number of deaths from a disease / Total number of cases of that disease) * 100%. In this scenario, CFR = (6 deaths / 30 cases) * 100% = 0.2 * 100% = 20%. The option '200/0' is likely a typo for 20%.

================================================================================
Question 460 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Two groups of patients 100 each, undergoing surgery was given antibiotic A and B respectively. After follow up 20 patients in group A developed infection and 5 in group B.which type of study is this?

Options:
  Case control study
  Cross sectional study
  Cohort study
✓ Non randomized trail
  Randomized trail

Explanation:
The study involves two groups receiving different interventions (antibiotic A vs. B) and being followed for an outcome (infection), which makes it a trial. However, if there is no mention of random assignment, it would be classified as a non-randomized trial (or quasi-experimental study). If randomization was implied but not stated, it would be a randomized trial, but without explicit mention, non-randomized is the safer interpretation if explicitly offered.

================================================================================
Question 461 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher wants to perform screening for undiagnosed, undetected cases of hepatitis B, and carriers of disease by rapidly applying tests and procedures, What will happen if the cutoff point is raised in Screening tests?

Options:
  Sensitivity increases and specificity decreases
✓ Sensitivity decreases and specificity increases
  Sensitivity and specificity both will increase
  Sensitivity and specificity will remain same
  Sensitivity and specificity both will decrease

Explanation:
If the cutoff point for a screening test is raised (i.e., a higher threshold is required for a positive result), the test becomes more stringent. This means fewer people will test positive, leading to a decrease in sensitivity (more false negatives) and an increase in specificity (fewer false positives). The test will correctly identify fewer true cases but will be better at correctly identifying truly healthy individuals.

================================================================================
Question 462 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher is interested in recording the number of individuals in a particular geographic region who had a common cold at some point during the month of February 2015.which of the following measures of morbidity would be the most appropriate in answering this question?

Options:
  Cumulative incidents
  lncidence density
  lncidence risk
✓ Period prevalence
  Point prevalence

Explanation:
Period prevalence measures the proportion of individuals in a population who have a disease at any point during a specified period of time (e.g., the month of February 2015). This is the most appropriate measure for capturing all individuals who experienced a common cold over that entire month.

================================================================================
Question 463 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
1n analytical studies we develop association between risk factors and a disease. Which of the following in case control studies ascertains whether there is an association between exposure status and occurrence of disease?

Options:
  Attributable risk
✓ Odds ratio
  Population attributable risk
  P value
  Relative risk

Explanation:
In case-control studies, the odds ratio (OR) is the primary measure of association used to quantify the relationship between an exposure (risk factor) and the occurrence of a disease. It estimates how many times higher the odds of exposure are among cases compared to controls.

================================================================================
Question 464 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher wants to establish, cause effect relationship in diabetic patients with their obesity before the onset of diabetes. What type of study he will do?

Options:
  Case studies
  Cross sectional studies
  Experimental studies
✓ Prospective cohort studies
  Retrospective cohort studies

Explanation:
To establish a cause-effect relationship between obesity (exposure) and the onset of diabetes (outcome), where obesity *precedes* diabetes, a prospective cohort study is the ideal observational design. Individuals are followed forward in time, and the incidence of diabetes is compared between those who were obese and those who were not, at the start of the study.

================================================================================
Question 465 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An officer in-charge of a police station being called for an immediate response in a public park for a person who was suspected to be mentally ill and needs to be taken to a safe place for evaluation, possible care and detention. What is the most appropriate time frame for detention in such cases?

Options:
  One week
✓ seventy two hours
  thirty six hours
  twelve hours
  twenty four hours

Explanation:
In many mental health legislations, the initial period for involuntary detention for assessment of a person suspected to be mentally ill is commonly set at 72 hours. This period allows for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and to determine if further legal holds or treatment are necessary.

================================================================================
Question 466 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A person heard strange voices instructing him to kill his own mother with a razor. But Ihe was afraid of doing it then. However, the next day, no voices were heard. He went downstairs, got a razor and cut his mother's throat silently from behind and killed her. What is this condition?

Options:
  Catatonic schizophrenia
  hebephrenic schizophrenia
  latephase schizophrenia
✓ paranoid schizophrenia
  schizophrenia simplex

Explanation:
The presence of auditory hallucinations (strange voices instructing him to kill) and acting on these commands, even with a delay, is highly indicative of schizophrenia. Given the nature of the voices (command hallucinations) and the organized but horrific act, paranoid schizophrenia is a strong consideration, though any schizophrenia with command hallucinations could lead to this. Hebephrenic (disorganized) and catatonic types have different primary symptom presentations.

================================================================================
Question 467 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young girl with temporary memory lost has left home In that state of mind and has now ended up in an unexpected place. She has no recall of the past, What is this condition?

Options:
✓ Fugue
  Shock
  Stupor
  Trance
  Twilight state

Explanation:
A dissociative fugue (formerly called psychogenic fugue) is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by temporary memory loss (amnesia) of identity or personal information, accompanied by sudden, unexpected travel away from home or one's customary surroundings. The individual has no recall of the past events during the fugue state. This perfectly matches the description.

================================================================================
Question 468 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Feeble mindedness morons, type of mental retardation In which a person can achieve social and vocational skills enough tor minimum self-support. What minimum mental age he has got?

Options:
  2 years old
  3 years old
  4 years old
  5 years old
✓ 6 years old

Explanation:
Historically, 'moron' corresponded to mild intellectual disability. Individuals with mild intellectual disability can often achieve academic skills up to a sixth-grade level and, with appropriate support, can live independently and achieve vocational self-sufficiency. A mental age of around 6 years or higher would typically allow for 'minimum self-support' skills in this historical classification.

================================================================================
Question 469 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 27-year-old woman witnessed a major automobile accident 2 weeks ago in which a few passengers were killed. Since the accident, she has been experiencing recurrent thoughts of the accident and has recurrent nightmares each night. Lately, she is reluctant to drive an. When she does ride in the car as a passenger she feels overly anxious. The most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is which of the following?

Options:
✓ Acute stress disorder
  Adjustment disorder
  GAD
  PTSD
  Phobic anxiety disorder

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of intrusive thoughts, recurrent nightmares, avoidance (reluctance to drive), and hyperarousal (overly anxious in car) following a traumatic event, lasting for 2 weeks, are characteristic of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). If these symptoms persist beyond one month, the diagnosis would typically shift to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

================================================================================
Question 470 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38-year-old woman presents to your clinic telling you that she has had disturbing, recurrent thoughts about harming her 7-month-old infant. She imagines using a knife to stab her child. Since having these distressing thoughts, she has removed al sharp objects from her kitchen & would avoid to go to kitchen or hold her child. The most accurate diagnosis for this condition is:

Options:
  Acute psychosis
  Generalized anxiety disorder
  lmpulse control disorder
✓ Obsessive compulsive disorder
  Schizophrenia

Explanation:
The patient's experience of disturbing, recurrent, intrusive thoughts (obsessions about harming her infant) and the compulsive behaviors she performs to reduce the anxiety associated with these thoughts (removing sharp objects, avoiding the kitchen/child) are hallmark features of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The thoughts are distressing and unwanted, and she attempts to neutralize them.

================================================================================
Question 471 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A student of university has problem in sleep without any major psychiatric illness. The first step in management of this student is:

Options:
  Benzodiazepine
  Melatonin
  Sedatives
✓ Sleep hygiene
  Zolpidem

Explanation:
For sleep problems without an underlying major psychiatric illness, the first-line and most appropriate management strategy is to address sleep hygiene. This involves optimizing environmental and behavioral factors that promote healthy sleep, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, avoiding caffeine/alcohol before bed, and regular exercise.

================================================================================
Question 472 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25- years- old man rushes to the emergency department holding his chest with racing heart, difficult breathing sweating, trembling and a constant fear of about to die. His complete physical exam & investigations are normal., He further told he had similar episodes in past almost every week. His condition is best explained by:

Options:
  Acute stress disorder
  Myocardial infarction
  Panic attack
✓ Panic disorder
  Thyrotoxic crisis

Explanation:
The recurrent, unexpected episodes of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms (racing heart, difficulty breathing, sweating, trembling) and cognitive symptoms (fear of dying), with normal physical exam and investigations, are classic for panic attacks. Since he has had similar episodes almost every week, this indicates Panic Disorder, which is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks and persistent concern about having more attacks or their consequences.

================================================================================
Question 473 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 18- year- old man was brought by his parents to the OPD with suspiciousness, believes that his actions, thoughts are in control of someone else. He hears voices commenting on his behavior when no one is around. He is displaying these symptoms for the last 6 months and his functionality has been affected adversely. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute and transient psychosis
  Bipolar affective disorder
  Delusional disorder
  Schizophrenia form disorder
✓ Schizophrenia

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of suspiciousness, delusions of control (thoughts/actions controlled by others), and auditory hallucinations (voices commenting on behavior), along with a duration of 6 months and significant functional impairment, are diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. Schizophreniform disorder would have a duration between 1 and 6 months.

================================================================================
Question 474 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30- year- old man believes that he has been gifted with special powers and will bring change in the whole world. He also believes he is a spiritual figure. He lacks insight into his illness. What psychopathology is he suffering from?

Options:
  Auditory hallucinations
  Border line personality disorder
✓ Delusions of grandiosity
  Narcissistic personality disorder
  Persecutory delusions

Explanation:
The patient's fixed, false beliefs of being gifted with special powers, having the ability to change the world, and being a spiritual figure, despite evidence to the contrary and a lack of insight, are characteristic of delusions of grandiosity. These are commonly seen in manic episodes of bipolar disorder or in psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.

================================================================================
Question 475 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70 year old man presents with loss of memory for recent events. He has forgotten his grandchildren has been unable to manage his personal finances. Also, he has lost his way while driving to familiar locations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Alzheimer disease
  Amyotrophic literal sclerosis
  Creutzfeldt Jacob disease
  Huntington disease
  Parkinson disease

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of progressive loss of memory for recent events, difficulty with executive functions (managing finances), and visuospatial disorientation (getting lost in familiar locations) are classic early to moderate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly.

================================================================================
Question 476 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old lady is suffering from fever, headache, vomiting and neck rigidity due to rupture of epidermoid cyst in the subarachnoid space. Which of the following is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Chemical meningitis
  Drug induced meningitis
  Immunological meningitis
  Parasitic meningitis
  Rickettsia meningitis

Explanation:
The rupture of an epidermoid cyst (which contains keratin and cholesterol debris) into the subarachnoid space can release irritating chemical substances. This can trigger an aseptic inflammatory response in the meninges, leading to symptoms of meningitis (fever, headache, vomiting, neck rigidity) but without bacterial infection, hence the term chemical meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 477 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 19 years-old female student living in college hostel presented to ER with 1 day history of fever and headache., On physical examination, her temperature was 39.1 Degree Celsius and her heart rate was 124/min. She was toxic. She had neck stiffness and there were small, purple and non- blanching catechize on her legs. Lumbar puncture showed elevated opening pressure, elevated protein, pleocytosis and low glucose. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Fungal meningitis
✓ Meningococcal meningitis
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage
  Tuberculous meningitis
  Viral encephalitis

Explanation:
The acute onset of high fever, headache, toxicity, neck stiffness, and the presence of a non-blanching petechial rash (small, purple lesions) are highly characteristic of meningococcal meningitis, caused by *Neisseria meningitidis*. The lumbar puncture findings (elevated pressure, protein, pleocytosis, and low glucose) further confirm bacterial meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 478 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 80 years-old female patient with atrial fibrillation came to ER with right sided weakness for the last 1 hour. Her past medical history includes transient schematic attack, hypertension and diabetes. She was taking warfarin which she stopped after mechanical fall one month back. Her examination showed Weakness In both upper and lower limbs on right side. A CT Scan head showed no interracial bleed.What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Bacterial meningitis
  Encephalitis
  lntracranial mass
✓ lschemic stroke
  Subdural hematoma

Explanation:
The sudden onset of right-sided weakness (hemiparesis/hemiplegia) in an elderly patient with atrial fibrillation (a major risk factor for cardioembolic stroke) and a history of stopping warfarin (increasing stroke risk) is highly suggestive of an ischemic stroke. A CT scan showing no intracranial bleed is consistent with an acute ischemic stroke (which may not be visible immediately on CT) rather than a hemorrhagic one.

================================================================================
Question 479 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20-years-old female patient presented with weakness in both lower limbs which initially started as numbness in toes. She had diarrhea two weeks back, which resolved by itself. On examination, power was USIn lower limbs and deep tendon reflexes were absent in lower limbs, What is the treatment of choice?

Options:
  Corticosteroids
✓ lntravenous Immunoglobulin
  Plasmapheresis
  Spinal surgery
  Thiamine and B12 administration

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of ascending paralysis (weakness in lower limbs, starting as numbness in toes), areflexia (absent deep tendon reflexes), and a preceding history of diarrhea (suggesting an antecedent infection) is classic for Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). The main treatments of choice for GBS are intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis. Both are equally effective in reducing the severity and duration of the illness. Given the options, IVIG is a very common treatment.

================================================================================
Question 480 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 79-years-old stumbled and sustained a minor head injury 2 weeks ago. He had become increasingly confused, drowsy and unsteady. He had fluctuating GCS scale. He was using warfarin for Atrial fibrillation.What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Cerebellar hemorrhage
  Epidural hemorrhage
  Extradural hemorrhage
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage
✓ Subdural hemorrhage

Explanation:
The patient's history of a minor head injury two weeks prior, followed by gradually worsening confusion, drowsiness, unsteadiness, and fluctuating GCS, especially in an elderly patient on anticoagulants (warfarin), is highly characteristic of a chronic or subacute subdural hemorrhage. Bridging veins are more fragile in the elderly and more susceptible to tearing, and anticoagulation exacerbates bleeding.

================================================================================
Question 481 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A man of 65 years was brought by his family for having lost his way back home several times. He could not recall the events for the past few months. On examination his pulse rate is 70/min regular and blood pressure (BP) 150/90mm Hg. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Alzheimer disease
  Cerebro vascular disease
  Depression
  Cerebellar degeneration
  Parkinson disease

Explanation:
The progressive loss of memory for recent events (inability to recall events for the past few months), and visuospatial disorientation (getting lost on the way home several times) in an elderly individual are classic symptoms of dementia, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common cause.

================================================================================
Question 482 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old man presented with recurrent transient ischemic attacks. He had progressive memory loss and right sided monoplegia (right upper limb). On examination, 'his blood pressure was 170/100 and pulse rate was 100/min, irregularly irregular. His Temperature was 98 F. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Alzheimer disease
  Encephalitis
✓ Multi infarct dementia
  Parkinsonism
  Prion disease

Explanation:
The patient's history of recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), progressive memory loss (dementia), focal neurological deficits (right-sided monoplegia), and uncontrolled hypertension with an irregularly irregular pulse (suggesting atrial fibrillation and embolic events) are all hallmark features of multi-infarct dementia (vascular dementia). This type of dementia is characterized by stepwise decline in cognitive function related to multiple small strokes.

================================================================================
Question 483 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young man of 40 years had recurrent episodes of involuntary movements of the whole body with loss of consciousness for the last one year. He had mouth frothing and urinary incontinence during the episode. He was hemodynamically stable. What Is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Absence seizures
  Simple partial seizures
  Psychomotor epilepsy
✓ Tonic clonic epilepsy
  Status epilepticus

Explanation:
Recurrent episodes of involuntary movements of the whole body (tonic-clonic movements), loss of consciousness, mouth frothing, and urinary incontinence are classic features of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly known as grand mal epilepsy). The stability between episodes is characteristic of recurrent seizures, differentiating it from status epilepticus.

================================================================================
Question 484 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 8 years old boy was brought by his family for episodes of mental disconnection but no involuntary movements. These episodes occurred briefly for a few seconds and Increased in severity with the passage of time. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Psychogenic attacks
✓ Absence seizures
  Metabolic encephalopathy
  Grand Mal epilepsy
  Transient ischemic attacks

Explanation:
The description of brief episodes of 'mental disconnection' (blanking out/staring spells) without involuntary movements, lasting a few seconds, and increasing in severity, particularly in a child, is classic for absence seizures (petit mal seizures). These involve a brief interruption of consciousness without prominent motor activity.

================================================================================
Question 485 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old girl was brought to medical emergency with slowly progressing ascending paralysis or lower 39st one week. Clinical examination showed pulse 110/min, BP 100/70 and Respiratory rare Ce/min. Power in lower limb was 0/5 and inner imbecile 1/5 Reflexes were absent and planters week 8 mg. She was treated for Acute upper re generator tract infection a week ago. She responded to which of the following treatment over the next 3 weeks?

Options:
  Broad spectrum antibiotics
✓ lntravenous Immunoglobulin
  I.V dexamethasone
  lV acyclovir
  Physiotherapy

Explanation:
The clinical picture of slowly progressing ascending paralysis of lower limbs, areflexia (absent reflexes, down-going plantars indicating flaccidity), and a preceding acute upper respiratory tract infection is highly suggestive of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). The treatment of choice for GBS, which she would respond to, is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone) are generally not recommended for GBS.

================================================================================
Question 486 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old male presented to you In emergency with history of loss of consciousness for 5 mint after RTA then regain consclousness and after one hour he become unconscious and his right pupil is dilated, What is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Chornic sub dural hematoma
✓ Extradural hematoma
  lntraparenchymal hematoma
  Subdural hematoma
  Subarachnoid hematoma

Explanation:
The classic history of trauma (RTA) followed by a brief loss of consciousness, then a lucid interval (regaining consciousness), and subsequent deterioration with re-loss of consciousness and ipsilateral (right) pupillary dilation, is the hallmark of an extradural (epidural) hematoma. This pattern is due to arterial bleeding (typically middle meningeal artery) causing rapid compression of the brain.

================================================================================
Question 487 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A one-month-old child presented to you In emergency with history of large head circumference with vomiting. On examination there is shiny skin and dilated veins on scalp and also has sun setting eye. What is your first line of investigation?

Options:
✓ B.U.S
  CSF RE
  CT Brain
  MRl brain

Explanation:
In a one-month-old infant with a rapidly increasing head circumference, vomiting, shiny scalp skin, dilated scalp veins, and 'sunsetting eyes' (all signs of increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus), the first-line and safest investigation is a B-mode ultrasound (B.U.S) of the brain. The open fontanelles in infants allow for excellent visualization of the ventricular system and hydrocephalus without radiation exposure.

================================================================================
Question 488 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Making the child hyperventilates for 3 minutes, can occasionally precipitate these seizures, name the seizure type.

Options:
✓ Absence seizures
  Complex partial seizures
  Myoclonic seizures
  Tonic clonic seizures
  Tonic seizures

Explanation:
Hyperventilation is a classic precipitating factor for absence seizures (petit mal seizures). The characteristic 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges on EEG, and the clinical blank stare or 'absence,' can often be induced or worsened by asking a child to hyperventilate.

================================================================================
Question 489 (KMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is this describing: Transient loss of muscle tone causing a sudden fall to the follow or drop of the head.

Options:
  Absence seizures
✓ Atonic seizures
  Myoclonic seizures
  Tonic clonic seizures
  Tonic seizures

Explanation:
Atonic seizures (also known as 'drop attacks') are characterized by a sudden, brief loss of muscle tone, leading to a sudden fall or head drop, without loss of consciousness (though it may appear so due to the sudden collapse). They are often resistant to treatment and can cause significant injury.

================================================================================
Question 490 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 years old man with a history of panic attacks came to OPD with symptoms of palpitations, sweating and dryness of mouth that didn't improve with psychotherapy. Which of the following drugs is most suitable to treat his panic disorder?

Options:
  Carbamazepine
✓ Escitalopram
  Haloperidol
  Thiopentone
  Phenelzine

Explanation:
Escitalopram is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) and is considered a first-line pharmacological treatment for panic disorder. It helps reduce the frequency and severity of panic attacks.

================================================================================
Question 491 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 52 years old man was shifted to Operation Theatre for the fracture of femur head. To reduce anxiety of the patient, the anesthetist injected which of the following drug along with general anesthetic?

Options:
✓ Midazolam
  Haloperidol
  Diazepam
  Phenobarbitone
  Atropine

Explanation:
Midazolam is a benzodiazepine widely used as a premedication before surgery to reduce anxiety (anxiolysis), provide sedation, and induce amnesia. It has a rapid onset and short duration of action, making it ideal for this purpose.

================================================================================
Question 492 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old female presented to emergency department with tonic colonic seizures. The nurse on duty gives her diazepam intravenously to control seizures. What is the most possible mechanism of action of diazepam?

Options:
  Closure of chloride channel
  Closure of sodium channel
  Closure of calcium channel
  Membrane depolarization
✓ Membrane hyperpolarization

Explanation:
Diazepam, like other benzodiazepines, enhances the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at GABA-A receptors. This increases the frequency of chloride channel opening, leading to an influx of chloride ions. This hyperpolarizes the neuronal membrane, making it less excitable and thus controlling seizures.

================================================================================
Question 493 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 28 years old man was brought unconscious to the emergency department who had an accidental overdose of clonazepam tablets. Which of the following drugs is used as an antidote for this toxicity?

Options:
  Acetylcysteine
  Atropine
  Dabigatran
✓ Flumazenil
  Naloxone

Explanation:
Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist at the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABA-A complex. It is the specific antidote used to reverse the sedative and respiratory depressant effects of benzodiazepine overdose, such as with clonazepam.

================================================================================
Question 494 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years old female comes for her first antenatal visit at 5th week of gestation. She tells her doctor that she is taking Paroxetine for depression for the past one month. Which of the following fetal complications is associated with its use?

Options:
  Abortion
✓ Cardiac malformations
  Growth retardation
  Prematurity
  Stillbirth

Explanation:
Paroxetine, an SSRI, has been associated with a small but significant increased risk of congenital cardiac malformations (such as ventricular septal defects) when taken during the first trimester of pregnancy.

================================================================================
Question 495 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 33-year-old female was brought to hospital for acute change in mental status noticed by her husband. He reports that she has been taking a drug for schizophrenia for the past one year. On examination, the woman is diaphoretic, with some rigidity of her extremities. Her BP is 198/99, temperature 101°F. Blood analyses show grossly elevated creatine kinase. Which of the following would be appropriate treatment for this patient?

Options:
  Escitalopram
  Chlorpromazine
✓ Dantrolene
  Fluoxetine
  Haloperidol

Explanation:
The patient presents with symptoms of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): mental status changes, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability, likely triggered by her antipsychotic medication. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant used as a specific treatment for NMS to reduce rigidity and hyperthermia.

================================================================================
Question 496 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 38-year-old male patient of epilepsy visits his physician for routine check-up. His seizures are well controlled by using a drug which acts by blocking sodium channels and modulation of NMDA receptors. Which one of the following drugs act through this mechanism?

Options:
  Carbamazepine
  Gabapentin
  Lamotrigine
  Phenytoin
✓ Sodium valproate

Explanation:
Sodium valproate (valproic acid) has a broad mechanism of action. It blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, enhances GABAergic transmission, and also blocks T-type calcium channels. Some evidence suggests it may also modulate NMDA (glutamate) receptors, contributing to its broad-spectrum efficacy.

================================================================================
Question 497 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5-year-old girl is brought to OPD because of episodic 'blanking out' which began one month ago. The patient has episodes in which she abruptly stops all activities, remains motionless with occasional fumbling hand movement for about 10 seconds, followed by a rapid return to full consciousness. Which of the following is drug of choice to treat this condition?

Options:
  Carbamazepine
✓ Ethosuximide
  Gabapentin
  Levetiracetam
  Phenytoin

Explanation:
The clinical description is classic for absence seizures (petit mal seizures). Ethosuximide is the first-line drug of choice specifically for uncomplicated absence seizures in children.

================================================================================
Question 498 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 67-year-old woman with a history of classic angina pectoris is seeking treatment for migraine headaches of moderate intensity. Which of the following drugs is contraindicated for treating migraine in this patient?

Options:
  Acetaminophen
  Aspirin
  Naproxen
  Propranolol
✓ Sumatriptan

Explanation:
Sumatriptan is a serotonin (5-HT1B/1D) agonist that causes vasoconstriction. It is contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris), uncontrolled hypertension, or other significant cardiovascular disease because it can cause coronary vasospasm and precipitate a cardiac event.

================================================================================
Question 499 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 05-year-old child is admitted to the hospital with a low-grade fever and a persistent cough that has resulted in vomiting episodes. After few days, his fever has resolved, and all that is left is a slight cough. He is discharged from the hospital by the pediatrician who recommends an over-the-counter cough antitussive. Which of the following did he recommend?

Options:
✓ Dextromethorphan
  Loperamide
  Naloxone
  Morphine
  Tramadol

Explanation:
Dextromethorphan is a widely used over-the-counter central antitussive (cough suppressant). It is an opioid derivative but lacks significant analgesic or addictive properties at therapeutic doses, making it suitable for suppressing a non-productive cough in children.

================================================================================
Question 500 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old patient, is brought to emergency room at 4:00 P.M by his friend after a road accident. He has multiple fractures and the surgeon decided to perform surgery. Which of the following is a potent analgesic but non-anesthetic drug?

Options:
  Benzodiazepine
  Halothane
✓ Ketamine
  Nitrous oxide
  Thiopental

Explanation:
Ketamine acts as a dissociative anesthetic that provides potent analgesia, sedation, and amnesia while preserving spontaneous respiration and airway reflexes. Unlike most other induction agents (like thiopental or propofol), it has profound analgesic properties.

================================================================================
Question 501 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6-year-old child was brought to ER with complaints of pain abdomen, vomiting and fever. He was diagnosed with ratio T.L.C. The Surgeon decided to perform laparotomy. Which of the following inhalational aesthetics is used for the induction agent of choice in children?

Options:
  Desflurane
  Halothane
  Isoflurane
  Methoxyflurane
✓ Sevoflurane

Explanation:
Sevoflurane is the inhalational induction agent of choice in children because it is non-pungent (sweet-smelling), has a rapid onset and offset, and causes less respiratory irritation compared to other volatile anesthetics like isoflurane or desflurane.

================================================================================
Question 502 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old male patient developed profound fever, skeletal muscle rigidity, autonomic hyperactivity and hypercarbia eleven hours hence as part of response to general anesthetic drug. Which of the following is most likely responsible for these symptoms?

Options:
  Ether
✓ Halothane
  Isoflurane
  Nitrous oxide
  Sevoflurane

Explanation:
The symptoms described (profound fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, hypercarbia) are characteristic of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH). This life-threatening condition is triggered by volatile anesthetics (like Halothane, Isoflurane, Sevoflurane) and succinylcholine. Historically, Halothane is a potent trigger.

Question:
A 37-year-old athlete with a history of anxiety continues to your clinic seeking a medication for long-term prophylaxis. Which of the following drugs would you avoid using in this patient?

Options:
  Fluoxetine
✓ Propranolol
  Topiramate
  Valproate
  Venlafaxine

Explanation:
Propranolol is a beta-blocker. In an athlete, beta-blockers can impair physical performance by limiting heart rate response to exercise and causing fatigue. Additionally, they are banned substances in some competitive sports. Therefore, they might be avoided if performance is a concern.

================================================================================
Question 504 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55 year old female who is a diagnosed case of psychiatric disease, presented to you for medical checkup. While looking at her prescription, you notice that she is taking Lithium carbonate (LC) for the last 5 years. What is the most probable disease for which she is using LC?

Options:
  Anxiety disorder
✓ Bipolar affective disorder
  Depression
  Obsessive compulsive disorder
  Schizophrenia

Explanation:
Lithium carbonate is the classic mood stabilizer and the first-line maintenance treatment for Bipolar Affective Disorder, preventing both manic and depressive episodes.

Question 505 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 33 years old female diagnosed with ovarian cancer and is on chemotherapy. She was operated for acute appendicitis, but she is also suffering from depression and could not make smooth recovery from anesthesia. Which one of the following drugs can be used without harmful interaction?

Options:
  Amitriptyline
  Bromazepam
  Carbamazepine
  Doxapram
✓ Ondansetron

Explanation:
Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist commonly used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and surgery (PONV). It generally has a safe profile and few drug interactions compared to other options like carbamazepine or TCAs, making it suitable for this patient.

================================================================================
Question 506 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A first-year surgery internee has rotated through various surgical disciplines, including general surgery, cardio-thoracic surgery, urology and surgical oncology. He is quite used to liberally ordering morphine for pain control. However, which of the following is NOT an approved indication for morphine?

Options:
  Acute pulmonary edema
  Femur fracture
✓ Closed head injury
  Myocardial infarction
  Renal colic

Explanation:
Morphine is generally contraindicated or used with extreme caution in closed head injuries because it causes respiratory depression, which leads to CO2 retention. Increased CO2 causes cerebral vasodilation, increasing intracranial pressure, which can be dangerous in a head injury patient.

================================================================================
Question 507 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An otolaryngology doctor decides to perform sinus surgery to debride the scarred sinus tissue. During the procedure he elects to use an agent that has good local anesthesia as well as vasoconstrictive properties. What agent might he use here?

Options:
✓ Cocaine
  Lidocaine
  Mepivacaine
  Procaine
  Tetracaine

Explanation:
Cocaine is unique among local anesthetics because it also possesses potent vasoconstrictive properties by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine. This dual action (anesthesia + hemostasis) makes it useful for topical anesthesia in ENT procedures like sinus surgery.

================================================================================
Question 508 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency room after he was found walking the streets, proclaiming himself “Master of the World.” The physician recommends starting the patient on lithium therapy for acute mania. Which of the following is associated with lithium use?

Options:
✓ Fine tremors
  Hyperthyroidism
  Urinary retention
  Weight loss
  Gingival hyperplasia

Explanation:
Fine hand tremor is a common and dose-dependent side effect of lithium therapy. It can occur at therapeutic levels. Lithium is also associated with hypothyroidism (not hyperthyroidism) and weight gain (not loss).

================================================================================
Question 509 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old male patient of depression visited his physician for follow-up. 06 months after using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Upon questioning, he revealed that he still had not returned to the normal activities and reluctantly admitted that he had not been taking his medication because of some of the side effects. Which one is likely to be the most bothersome?

Options:
  Headache
✓ Sexual dysfunction
  Tachycardia
  Tremor
  Weight gain

Explanation:
Sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation/anorgasmia) is a very common and often persistent side effect of SSRIs that can lead to non-adherence, as patients may find it particularly bothersome.

================================================================================
Question 510 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 years old male patient died from herpetic encephalitis. Which of the following is relevant microscopic feature post mortem examination of his brain:

Options:
✓ Cowdry bodies
  Lewy bodies
  Negri bodies
  Nissl substance
  Neuropil

Explanation:
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is characterized histopathologically by the presence of Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusion bodies in neurons and glial cells.

================================================================================
Question 511 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10 years old child was having posterior fossa mass on CT scan. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Astrocytoma
  Arachnoid cyst
  Glioma
✓ Medulloblastoma
  Ependymoma

Explanation:
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children and is located in the posterior fossa (specifically the cerebellum). Other posterior fossa tumors in children include pilocytic astrocytoma (A) and ependymoma (E), but medulloblastoma is statistically very common in this age group.

================================================================================
Question 512 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A young lady was suffering from left cerebral hemisphere tumor on CT scan examination. The tumor was dural based and shifted the ventricle to one side. Which one is the most relevant diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Meningioma
  Neurofibromatosis
  Primary germ cell tumor
  Tuberous sclerosis
  Viral encephalitis

Explanation:
A dural-based tumor causing mass effect (shifting the ventricle) is a classic description of a meningioma. Meningiomas are common benign tumors arising from the arachnoid cap cells and are typically attached to the dura.

================================================================================
Question 513 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 64 year old homeless male alcoholic is brought to the hospital by a friend because he was not eating much for a month and was "acting strange." He was febrile, emaciated, lethargic, and disoriented. The cerebrospinal fluid had straw-colored 620 white blood cells per mm3, which were all lymphocytes, 300 erythrocytes, 90% neutrophils, and the protein and fluorochrome stains revealed no organisms. What is a likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Coccidioidomycosis
  Cryptococcosis
  Lyme disease
✓ Tuberculosis
  Viral meningitis

Explanation:
The clinical picture (chronic, alcoholic, fever, confusion) and CSF findings (lymphocytic pleocytosis, high protein - implied by 'straw colored' and high cell count, though not explicitly stated high protein value, low glucose is typical for TB) are highly suggestive of Tuberculous meningitis. The question text has a contradiction saying 'all lymphocytes' then '90% neutrophils'. Assuming chronic presentation and lymphocytes dominates in TB usually, but mixed can occur early. However, TB is common in alcoholics/homeless. Note: Fluorochrome stain negative makes TB less likely on *smear*, but it's often negative. Let's reconsider. Alcoholic + confusion = Wernicke's? But febrile. Bacterial meningitis in alcoholic? Listeria/Strep. But cells are mixed. If the question implies lymphocytic dominance (despite the typo '90% neutrophils' which contradicts 'all lymphocytes'), TB or Fungal (Cryptococcus) are top differentials. Cryptococcus is common in immunocompromised. But TB is very common in homeless. Let's assume the question meant lymphocytes. TB meningitis fits the subacute course.

================================================================================
Question 514 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old male is diagnosed with a brain tumor arising in the white matter. The tumor appears to be rapidly expanding, gray, and poorly defined. Microscopic examination of his brain revealed an increased number of glial cells appearing in a palisading manner. It is determined that the patient will only survive for a few months. What will be gross feature of this tumor?

Options:
✓ Butterfly appearance
  Increased gliosis
  Liquefactive necrosis
  Lymphocytic infiltration and lipid laden macrophage
  Spongiform appearance

Explanation:
The description (rapidly expanding, white matter, palisading necrosis, poor prognosis) is classic for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Grossly, GBM often crosses the corpus callosum to involve both hemispheres, creating a characteristic 'butterfly' appearance.

================================================================================
Question 515 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Following a bar fight, a 22-year-old man is brought unconscious to the emergency department. Several minutes earlier, he had been hit on the head with a heavy iron club and had been briefly unconscious, but had then apparently recovered. One or two minutes later, he had again lost consciousness. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Epidural hematoma
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage
  Subdural hematoma
  Stroke
  Transient ischemic attack

Explanation:
The clinical history of a head injury followed by a brief loss of consciousness, a lucid interval (apparent recovery), and then rapid deterioration/unconsciousness is the classic presentation of an epidural hematoma, usually due to rupture of the middle meningeal artery.

================================================================================
Question 516 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A newborn girl is found to have herniation of both the spinal cord and meninges through a defect in the vertebral arch of the spinal column. Her mother had not had prenatal care and had not taken nutritional supplements during pregnancy. Which of the following best describes this defect?

Options:
  Anencephaly
  Hydrocephalous
  Meningocele
✓ Meningomyelocele
  Spina bifida occulta

Explanation:
Herniation of *both* the meninges and the spinal cord through a vertebral defect is defined as a meningomyelocele (or myelomeningocele). A meningocele involves herniation of meninges only.

================================================================================
Question 517 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old man has a 2 day history of worsening generalized headache and increasing obtundation. He previously complained of stiffness in his neck. On physical examination vital signs include T 38.7C, BP 150/85 mmHg, P 96/min, R 20/minute, and blood pressure 130/85 mmHg. A CBC reveals a WBC count of 16,850/microliter. Serum electrolytes include a glucose of 88 mg/dL. A lumbar puncture draws turbid cerebrospinal fluid with a glucose of 32 mg/dL, protein 148 mg/dL, and a total of 380 WBCs (95% PMN’s) per mm3, and is positive for gram-negative rods. He receives antibiotic therapy and improves. Which of the following long-term complications is most likely to develop from this man's current disease?

Options:
  Cerebral infarction
  Cerebellar tonsillar herniation
  Encephalitis
✓ Hydrocephalous
  Subdural hematoma

Explanation:
The patient has bacterial meningitis (likely *E. coli* or *Klebsiella* given gram-negative rods). A common long-term complication of bacterial meningitis due to scarring of arachnoid granulations or obstruction of CSF flow is hydrocephalus.

================================================================================
Question 518 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 58-year-old man presented with tinnitus, ipsilateral loss of hearing, unsteadiness and dizziness. Symptoms were first noted 9 months ago and have progressed very slowly. If the cause is a tumor, which of the following is most likely?

Options:
  Ependymoma
  Glioblastoma
✓ Medulloblastoma
  Neuroblastoma
  Meningioma

Explanation:
The symptoms (tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness) point to a cerebellopontine angle lesion affecting the 8th cranial nerve. The most common tumor here is an Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma). However, it is not listed. Meningioma is the second most common. Medulloblastoma is a pediatric tumor. Ependymoma is rare here. If 'Acoustic Neuroma' is missing, Meningioma is the best fit among adults. However, the provided key/mark suggests Medulloblastoma, which is medically incorrect for this demographic and presentation. I will record the clinically most appropriate alternative from the list if valid, or note the discrepancy. Actually, Vestibular Schwannoma is synonymous with Acoustic Neuroma. Given the options, Meningioma is the most plausible adult CP angle tumor listed. If forced to follow a potentially erroneous key, I will note it.

================================================================================
Question 519 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 75-year-old woman appears after she slipping on wet pavement and striking the right side of her head. She did not remember fall. She complained of persistent headache and confusion. Magnetic imaging studies revealed a subdural hematoma over the lateral aspect of the right cerebral hemisphere. Which of the following is a well-known characteristic of this disorder?

Options:
  Bleeding from arterial rupture
✓ Caused by venous haemorrhage
  Associated with hyperactivity
  Laceration of branches of middle meningeal artery
  Rapidly progressive

Explanation:
Subdural hematomas are typically caused by the tearing of bridging veins that drain from the cerebral surface to the dural sinuses. They are venous hemorrhages, unlike epidural hematomas which are arterial.

================================================================================
Question 520 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10 years old child is suffering from fever, headache, vomiting and neck rigidity. On physical examination CSF is purulent. Laboratory report shows increase protein and decrease sugar. Which one of the following is the causative organism?

Options:
  Escherichia coli
✓ Neisseria meningitis
  Streptococcus pyogenes
  Staphylococcus aureus
  Salmonella typhi

Explanation:
*Neisseria meningitidis* (meningococcus) is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, characterized by purulent CSF with low glucose and high protein.

================================================================================
Question 521 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 65 years old male patient is suffering from acute pyogenic meningitis. Which of the following is not relevant to this condition?

Options:
  Cloudy or purulent CSF
  Increased pressure
✓ Lymphocyte count raised to 90,000/mm3
  Raised protein levels
  Neutrophil’s count raised to 90,000/mm3

Explanation:
Acute pyogenic (bacterial) meningitis typically presents with a predominance of *neutrophils* (PMNs) in the CSF, not lymphocytes. Lymphocytic predominance is characteristic of viral or tuberculous meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 522 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
CT scan findings of a 12 years old child show brain abscess. Which of the following is not the predisposing conditions?

Options:
  Anatomic anomalies
✓ Blood dyscrasias
  Neurosurgery
  Penetrating cranial trauma
  Pyogenic extra-neural infections

Explanation:
Brain abscesses are typically caused by direct extension from adjacent infections (sinusitis, otitis), hematogenous spread (endocarditis, lung abscess), or trauma/surgery. Blood dyscrasias (like anemia or clotting disorders) are not a direct predisposing factor for brain abscess formation.

================================================================================
Question 523 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 2-year-old child presents with fever, headache, prostration, and nuchal rigidity. The CSF is cloudy, and microscopic examination reveals innumerable neutrophils. The CSF protein is increased, and glucose is decreased. The most likely etiologic agent is which organism?

Options:
  Escherichia coli
  Group B streptococci
  Hemophilus influenzae
✓ Streptococcus pneumoniae
  Staphylococcus aureus

Explanation:
In a 2-year-old child (post-neonatal period), *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Neisseria meningitidis* are the most common causes of bacterial meningitis. *Haemophilus influenzae* type b has decreased due to vaccination. *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is a very likely cause.

================================================================================
Question 524 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 70-year-old man presents with loss of memory for recent events. He has no history of substance abuse. He has forgotten his grandchildren’s names, and he has been unable to manage his personal finances. Also, he has lost his way while driving to familiar locations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Alzheimer disease
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
  Huntington disease
  Parkinson disease
  Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome

Explanation:
The progressive loss of short-term memory (recent events), cognitive decline affecting daily activities (finances), and disorientation (getting lost), particularly in an elderly patient without other specific neurological signs, is the classic presentation of Alzheimer's disease.

================================================================================
Question 525 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In glioblastoma multiforme, which of the following molecular findings would support a primary, rather than secondary, tumor origin?

Options:
  p53 mutation
  MGMT promoter methylation
  1p19q translocation
✓ EGFR mutation
  NF2 mutation

Explanation:
Primary Glioblastomas (de novo) typically are characterized by EGFR amplification/mutation and PTEN mutations. Secondary Glioblastomas (progressing from lower-grade astrocytomas) are characterized by IDH mutations and p53 mutations.

================================================================================
Question 526 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 68-year-old man presents with increasing headache and "clumsiness" on the left side over the past two months. On examination he had left pronator drift and 4/5 weakness in left extremity muscles, and moderate sensory loss in the left extremities. MRI shows a large infiltrating lesion centered in the right parietal cortex and expanding the corpus callosum, surrounded by edema. The most likely histologic appearance of this tumor is:

Options:
  fibrillary cells with true ependymal rosettes
  Glial cell proliferation
✓ nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis, multiple mitoses
  primitive cells resembling cerebellar granular cells, numerous mitoses
  Spindled cells arranged in sheets and whorls, no mitoses

Explanation:
The clinical presentation and MRI findings (large infiltrating lesion, crossing corpus callosum - 'butterfly glioma') are classic for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). The histologic hallmarks of GBM are nuclear pleomorphism, high mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis (often with pseudopalisading).

================================================================================
Question 527 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old man got a new job that was extremely stressful. He began to have anxiety and panic episodes. As a result, he took benzodiazepine from a co-worker to help him cope with his anxiety and panic attack, but he recently overdosed. His colleagues brought him to ER within 15 minutes. As a doctor which antidote would you give to this patient?

Options:
  Acetaminophen
✓ Flumazenil
  Nalorphine
  Naloxone
  Zolpidem

Explanation:
Flumazenil is the specific antidote for benzodiazepine overdose. It works by competitively inhibiting the activity of benzodiazepine on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.

================================================================================
Question 528 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A person was given a barbiturate overdose, experienced giddiness, ataxia, slurred speech, delirium, and excitement, but as the poisoning progressed, the person became hypotensive, hypothermic, and cyanotic, with an abnormal breathing pattern. In the advanced stages of barbiturate poisoning, what form of abnormal respiratory pattern is commonly seen?

Options:
  Agonistic breathing
  Biot's breathing
✓ Cheyne-Stokes breathing
  Hyperpnea breathing

Cheyne-Stokes breathing (cyclic breathing marked by a gradual increase, then decrease in tidal volume, followed by apnea) is a common respiratory pattern seen in deep coma associated with central nervous system depression, including severe barbiturate poisoning.

================================================================================
Question 529 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A housewife with a severe cough was prescribed a syrup that disrupts her sleep. To get some restful sleep, she decided to take Chloral hydrate as a hypnotic. The family was unaware of the hypnotic nature of the dosage. Her attendants rushed her to the emergency room, where she was given a stomach wash. What would be used for chloral hydrate poisoning for gastric lavage?

Options:
  Alkali
✓ Charcoal powder
  Potassium permanganate
  Urine bleaching
  Soda bicarbonate

Explanation:
Activated charcoal is a general adsorbent used in gastric lavage for many poisonings, including sedatives like chloral hydrate, to prevent further absorption.

================================================================================
Question 530 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An officer in charge of a police station was involved in an emergency response in a public park for a person who was suspected to be mentally ill and needed to be taken to a secure place for evaluation and possible care. How much detention time should not exceed in such cases?

Options:
  One week
✓ 24 hours
  Thirty-six hours
  Twelve hours
  Seventy-four hours

Explanation:
According to the Mental Health Ordinance/Act (e.g., in Pakistan or UK Section 136), a person removed from a public place by police for suspected mental disorder can be detained at a place of safety for assessment for a maximum period of 24 hours (previously 72 hours in some jurisdictions, but 24 hours is the current standard in many updated acts like UK 2017 amendment).

================================================================================
Question 531 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:

Options:
  Auditory hallucinations
  Confabulations
✓ Delusion
  Illusion
  Impulse

Explanation:
The husband is suffering from a delusion of infidelity (Othello syndrome), which is a fixed, false belief that one's partner is unfaithful, despite a lack of evidence.

================================================================================
Question 532 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A man is having a major problem of having a long term idea occurring in his mind with irresistible force. The person is unable to drive away the said idea from his mind. What is the diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Delusion
✓ Impulse
  Intellect
  Illusion
  Thought

Explanation:
An impulse is a sudden, irresistible urge to perform an act. However, a persistent idea that intrudes into the mind against one's will is an *obsession*. Given the options, 'Impulse' might be the intended answer for an irresistible force, or it describes the urge component. But 'long term idea' describes an obsession. If 'Obsession' is not an option, 'Impulse' relates to the irresistible nature.

================================================================================
Question 533 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A married couple was living a stressful life due to many domestic problems. The husband was of view that the wife is attempting to kill him by slow poisoning; however, in reality there wasn't any such scenario. What type of delusion does the husband have?

Question 538 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A mentally retarded person was brought to you for mental age assessment. Upon examination of skills the person was socially and occupationally weak. Your assessment was that he can minimally self-support himself. You put him under category of feeble morons. According to this assessment what is the person's mental age?

Options:
  2 years old
  3 years old
  4 years old
✓ 5 years old
  6 years old

Explanation:
In older classifications, 'morons' (mild intellectual disability) typically have a mental age of about 7-10 years (or IQ 50-70). 'Imbeciles' (moderate) have a mental age of 3-7 years (IQ 25-50). The description 'can minimally self-support himself' often aligns with the upper end of moderate or lower end of mild. A mental age of 5-6 years corresponds to the 'Imbecile' range or lower end of educable.

================================================================================
Question 539 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A young male was brought to the emergency department with pin-point pupil, moist, perspiring skin, and with odour alcoholic smell. Which of the following is characteristics breathing will be recorded in the said poisoning?

Options:
  Fast breathing
  Fast-Absent breathing
  Fast-Slow-Absent breathing
✓ Slow breathing
  Slow-Fast breathing

Explanation:
Pinpoint pupils are a hallmark of opioid (or organophosphate) poisoning. In opioid overdose, respiratory depression is a key feature, manifesting as slow, shallow breathing (bradypnea). Though 'alcoholic smell' might suggest alcohol, the pinpoint pupils point strongly to opioids (or mixed).

================================================================================
Question 540 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A young mechanic male was autopsied in the Department of Forensic Medicine, KMC, Peshawar. The examination revealed severe non-specific asphyxia signs, cyanosed face, and froth from mouth/nose with intense black PM lividity. Which type of poisoning is this?

Options:

Explanation:
This sensation is known as 'Magnan's symptoms' or 'cocaine bugs', a tactile hallucination where the person feels like insects are crawling under the skin. It is characteristic of chronic cocaine abuse/poisoning.

================================================================================
Question 543 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The defense based on insanity is an ordinary practice in courts of law, wherein the accused is given the relief. In which one of the following circumstances, the defense based on Mc Naughton rule cannot be applied?

Options:
  Defect of reason
✓ Knowledge that act was wrong
  Nature of act
  Absence of will
  Quality of act

Explanation:
The McNaughton Rules state that a person is not criminally responsible if, at the time of the act, they were labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act they were doing; or, if they did know it, that they did not know what they were doing was wrong. If the person *did* have knowledge that the act was wrong, the defense cannot be applied.

Curare (tubocurarine) is a highly potent neuromuscular blocker. The fatal dose is relatively small, often cited in the range of 10-20 mg (or up to 60mg depending on source/route), causing respiratory paralysis.

================================================================================
Question 545 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In an outbreak of food poisoning in a union council of 3500 population, 30 cases of food poisoning had occurred after attending a wedding ceremony with 6 deaths. What is the case fatality rate in this scenario?

Options:
  10%
✓ 20%
  30%
  40%
  50%

Explanation:
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) = (Number of deaths from disease / Number of diagnosed cases of that disease) * 100. CFR = (6 / 30) * 100 = 20%.

================================================================================
Question 546 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher looked at accuracy of the breast cancer self-examination (BSE) in diagnosing breast cancer as compared to mammography and he found that mammography is more accurate in identifying true positives. How would you express this epidemiologically?

Options:
  Mammography should be adopted as the only method of screening for breast cancer
  Predictive value of BSE is more or less the same as that of mammography
  Sensitivity of BSE is more than specificity
✓ Sensitivity of mammography is more than that of BSE
  Sensitivity of BSE is same as that of mammography

Explanation:
Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positives). If mammography is more accurate in identifying true positives than BSE, it means the sensitivity of mammography is higher than that of BSE.

================================================================================
Question 547 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The Occurrence of cancer was identified between April 1991 and July 2002 for 50,000 troops who served in the first Gulf War (ended April 1991) and 50,000 troops who served elsewhere during the same period. What is the epidemiological study design in this scenario?

Options:
  Case control study
✓ Cohort study
  Cross sectional study
  Quasi experimental study
  Randomized control trial

Explanation:
This is a cohort study. Two groups (cohorts) defined by their exposure status (served in Gulf War vs. served elsewhere) are followed forward in time (from 1991 to 2002) to determine the incidence of an outcome (cancer).

================================================================================
Question 548 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The Serum cholesterol levels for three groups of people in a community were recorded in 2020. The mean cholesterol levels of the three groups were compared. Which of the following test of significance would you employ to determine whether the measurements were significantly different or not?

Options:
✓ Analysis of variance
  Chi square test
  Pearson's r
  Regression analysis
  Student's test

Explanation:
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is the appropriate statistical test to compare the means of three or more independent groups to see if at least one group mean is statistically different from the others.

================================================================================
Question 549 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Errors and bias are common in any significance testing and one may commit either Type-1 error or Type-2 error. Which one of the following describes Type-2 error?

Options:
✓ Accepting false null hypothesis
  Accepting true null hypothesis
  Either one can be accepted or rejected
  Rejecting false null hypothesis
  Rejecting true null hypothesis

Explanation:
A Type II error (beta error) occurs when one fails to reject (accepts) a null hypothesis that is actually false. In other words, it is failing to detect a difference or effect when one actually exists.

================================================================================
Question 550 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An epidemiologist calculates the relative risk to show the association of tobacco dip (Naswar) with nasopharyngeal gland carcinoma. What does this rate indicate?

Options:
✓ It is the ratio of disease risk for those exposed and not exposed to a particular risk factor
  It cannot be greater than 1
  Shows the percentage contribution that a risk factor makes towards the occurrence of disease
  Shows the relationship between incidence and prevalence as the risk factor of disease
  Shows the relationship between incidence and prevalence as the risk factor of disease

Explanation:
Relative Risk (Risk Ratio) is defined as the ratio of the risk (incidence) of disease in the exposed group to the risk (incidence) of disease in the unexposed group.

================================================================================
Question 551 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher wants to determine the most common age of patients with colorectal cancer which was found out to be 42 years. He represented the data graphically. What would be the most likely shape of this frequency distribution?

Options:
  Bell shaped Gaussian curve
  Bimodal distribution
  Negatively skewed
✓ Positively skewed
  Straight line

Explanation:
Colorectal cancer is more common in older age. If the 'most common age' (mode) was found to be 42, which is relatively young for colorectal cancer, and the distribution likely extends to older ages where the disease is also prevalent or more so (creating a long tail towards the right/older ages), it might be positively skewed. However, typically cancer age distributions are negatively skewed (tail towards younger ages, bulk at older). But if the *finding* was 42, this implies a younger cluster. Without more data, a bell curve is a standard assumption, but age-incidence curves are often skewed. Given 42 is young, a positive skew (tail to right) is standard for age distributions starting young.

================================================================================
Question 552 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The number of attacks of angina per year in a sample of 50 men with a history of myocardial infarction, aged 50-60 years is an example of what type of variable?

Options:
  Nominal variable
  Qualitative continuous variable
  Qualitative discrete variable
  Quantitative continuous variable
✓ Quantitative discrete variable

Explanation:
The number of attacks (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3...) is a numerical count. It can only take whole number values (you can't have 2.5 attacks). Therefore, it is a quantitative discrete variable.

================================================================================
Question 553 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
As a medical student, you were assigned a research project. In medical statistics, which p value is considered significant?

Options:
✓ P < 0.05
  P < 0.5
  P > 0.5
  P < 1.00
  P > 0.05

Explanation:
In medical statistics and most scientific research, a p-value less than 0.05 is conventionally considered statistically significant, indicating less than a 5% probability that the observed results occurred by chance.

================================================================================
Question 554 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher conducted a study to determine the association between lung cancer and smoking. The main disadvantage of this study deign is recall bias. Which type of study design was adopted?

Options:
✓ Case control
  Cohort study
  Correlation study design
  Cross sectional study design
  Randomized control trials

Explanation:
Case-control studies are particularly susceptible to recall bias because participants (cases with the disease and controls without) are asked to remember past exposures (like smoking habits), and those with the disease may recall exposures differently than those without.

================================================================================
Question 555 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In a Normal distribution curve, 95 % confidence interval falls within which category?

Options:
  + 1 Standard deviation of the mean
✓ + 2 Standard deviation of the mean
  + 3 Standard deviation of the mean
  + 4 Standard deviation of the mean
  + 5 Standard deviation of the mean

Explanation:
In a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the values lie within plus or minus 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, which is commonly rounded to +/- 2 standard deviations.

================================================================================
Question 556 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Chi square is one of the tests of significance used for hypothesis testing. On which type of data we apply Chi square test?

Options:
  Quantitative
✓ Categorical
  Continuous
  Confounder
  Discrete

Explanation:
The Chi-square test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.

================================================================================
Question 557 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The number of newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer per 100,000 women during a given year is expressed as:

Options:
✓ Incidence
  Prevalence
  Proportion
  Rate
  Ratio

Explanation:
Incidence refers to the number of *new* cases of a disease that develop in a population at risk during a specified time period. Expressing it per 100,000 population makes it an incidence rate.

================================================================================
Question 558 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher wants to establish cause effect relationship between diabetes and risk factors. What type of study he will do?

Options:
✓ Prospective studies
  Retrospective studies
  Experimental studies
  Cross Sectional studies
  Case studies

Explanation:
Prospective cohort studies are the most powerful observational design for establishing cause-and-effect relationships because they establish temporal sequence (exposure precedes outcome). Experimental studies (RCTs) are stronger but often not feasible or ethical for etiologic research.

================================================================================
Question 559 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In epidemiological evaluation, there are chances of bias and errors. Thus high quality design and methods are used to deal with such outcomes. In order to find association between the number of parity and the down's syndrome: Which type of variable, maternal age would be?

Options:
✓ Confounding variable
  Constant variable
  Dependent variable
  Independent variable
  Outcome variable

Explanation:
Maternal age is known to be associated with both parity (older mothers tend to have higher parity) and the risk of Down syndrome (risk increases with age). Therefore, it acts as a confounding variable that can distort the true association between parity and Down syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 560 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A town whose population is 20,000. 70% are Muslims, 20% Christians, 10% Hindus. If a researcher wants to take 10% of population for his study in that area. Which one of the following is the best sampling technique?

Options:
  Cluster sampling
  Purposive sampling
  Simple random sampling
✓ Stratified random sampling
  Systematic sampling

Explanation:
Stratified random sampling is the best technique here because the population is heterogeneous (divided into distinct religious subgroups). Stratifying ensures that each subgroup is represented in the sample in proportion to its size in the population.

================================================================================
Question 561 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In our community, coronary heart disease (CHD) and Diabetes are emerging public health problems, which needs early diagnosis and prompt treatment. For early identification of cases, which one of the following is the most economical method of screening?

Options:
✓ High risk screening
  Mass screening
  Multi phasic screening
  Prescriptive screening
  Prospective screening

Explanation:
High-risk (or selective) screening is the most economical method because it targets testing only to those individuals who have known risk factors for the disease, thereby increasing the yield of true positives and reducing costs compared to mass screening of the entire population.

================================================================================
Question 562 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Fourth year medical students were engaged in a research study to find the co-relation between smoking and lung cancer. While setting objectives for their study, which of the following characteristic of objectives should be kept in mind?

Options:
  Complex
  Costly
  Independent of time
✓ Measurable
  Over-ambitious

Explanation:
Research objectives should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Being 'measurable' is a key characteristic.

================================================================================
Question 563 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In a study, the hypothesis was stated as “Increased levels of glycosylated hemoglobin levels for prolonged periods of time in diabetic individuals increase the risk for myocardial infarction”. In this study, which one of the following statements fits the above-mentioned hypothesis?

Options:
✓ It is an assumption made before the start of research
  It is a conclusion drawn before start of research
  It shows that his hypothesis and null hypothesis are identical in this study
  It shows significance level
  It shows that the above statement is a tested theory

Explanation:
A hypothesis is a tentative prediction or explanation of the relationship between two or more variables. It is an assumption made *before* the research is conducted to be tested.

================================================================================
Question 564 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Estimation of magnitude of health problem is required for future planning and administrative purposes. Which of the following rate a public health officer will calculate for this purpose?

Options:
  Birth
  Death
  Growth
  Incidence
✓ Prevalence

Explanation:
Prevalence measures the total number of existing cases of a disease in a population at a given time. It indicates the magnitude or burden of the health problem, which is crucial for planning health services and resource allocation.

================================================================================
Question 565 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
The Government wants to collect Morbidity data for districts in order to allocate resources equitably. However, it does not have sufficient human resource and time to conduct a detailed survey. Which one of the following indicators can the government obtain quickly from District hospitals to know about morbidity status?

Options:
  Monthly expenditure of the hospital
✓ Total bed occupancy of a hospital in a month
  Total deaths in admitted patients per month
  Total number of surgeries performed per month
  Total number of surgeries performed per month

Explanation:
Total bed occupancy (or hospital admission rates) provides a quick, albeit rough, proxy for the burden of severe morbidity in the community that requires hospitalization, and is readily available from hospital records.

================================================================================
Question 566 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
In analytical studies, we develop association between risk factors and a disease. Which of the following in case control studies ascertain whether there is an association between exposure status and outcome of disease?

Options:
  Attributable risk
✓ Odds ratio
  Population attributable risk
  P-value
  Relative risk

Explanation:
The measure of association calculated in a case-control study is the Odds Ratio (OR). It compares the odds of exposure in cases to the odds of exposure in controls. Relative risk cannot be directly calculated in a case-control study.

================================================================================
Question 567 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Emotional intelligence is characterized by which one of the following?

Options:
✓ Better interpersonal skills
  Good sense of humor
  High abstract thinking
  High critical thinking abilities
  Proficiency in problem solving

Explanation:
Emotional intelligence involves the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions and those of others. A key characteristic and outcome of high emotional intelligence is better interpersonal skills and relationships.

================================================================================
Question 568 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
When the group disagree over how the work should get done. The type of conflict experienced is:

Options:
✓ Process conflict
  Relationship conflict
  Task related conflict
  Traditional conflict
  None of the above

Explanation:
Process conflict refers to disagreements about *how* work should be accomplished, including delegation and logistics. Task conflict is about the *content* and goals of the work.

================================================================================
Question 569 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An 80-year-old patient with atrial fibrillation came to ER with right sided weakness for the last 1 hour. Her past medical history includes transient ischemic attack, hypertension and diabetes. She was taking warfarin which she stopped after a fall one month back. Her examination shows weakness of the face, arm and legs on right side. A CT scan head showed no intracranial bleed. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Bacterial meningitis
  Encephalitis
  Intracranial mass
✓ Ischemic stroke
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage

Explanation:
The sudden onset of focal neurological deficit (right-sided weakness) in an elderly patient with risk factors (AFib, HTN, DM, stopped anticoagulation) and a negative CT for bleed is classic for an acute ischemic stroke.

================================================================================
Question 570 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 19 years old female student living in college hostel presented to ER with 1 day history of fever and headache. On physical examination, her temperature was 39.1 Degree Celsius and her heart rate was 124/min. She was toxic. She had neck stiffness and there were small, purple and non-blanching petechiae on both her legs. Lumbar puncture showed elevated opening pressure, elevated protein, pleocytosis and low glucose. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Fungal meningitis
✓ Meningococcical meningitis
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage
  Tuberculous meningitis
  Viral Encephalitis

Explanation:
The presentation of fever, headache, neck stiffness, and a characteristic petechial/purpuric rash in a young adult (especially living in close quarters like a hostel) is pathognomonic for Meningococcal meningitis (*Neisseria meningitidis*). The CSF findings support bacterial meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 571 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 75-year-old was brought by her friend and sustained a minor head injury 2 weeks ago. He had become increasingly confused, drowsy and unsteady. He had fluctuating GCS scale. He was using warfarin for Atrial fibrillation. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Cerebellar hemorrhage
  Epidural hemorrhage
  Extradural hemorrhage
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage
✓ Subdural hemorrhage

Explanation:
Chronic subdural hematoma is common in the elderly, especially those on anticoagulants, following minor head trauma. Symptoms often develop insidiously over weeks, including confusion, drowsiness, and fluctuation in consciousness.

================================================================================
Question 572 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old man presented with profound, transient ischemic attacks. He had progressive memory loss and right sided monoplegia (right upper limb). On examination, his blood pressure was (BP) 170/100 and pulse rate was 100/min irregularly irregular. His Temperature was 98°F. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Alzheimer disease
  Encephalitis
✓ Multi infarct dementia
  Parkinsonism
  Prion disease

Explanation:
The combination of vascular risk factors (hypertension, likely atrial fibrillation given irregular pulse), focal neurological deficits (monoplegia), history of TIAs, and progressive cognitive decline (memory loss) points to Multi-infarct dementia (Vascular dementia).

================================================================================
Question 573 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 8 years old girl was brought by her family for episodes of mental disconnection but no involuntary movements. These episodes occurred briefly for a few seconds and increased in frequency over the passage of time. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
  Atonic seizures
✓ Absence seizures
  Metabolic encephalopathy
  Pshycogenic attacks
  TIAS

Explanation:
Brief episodes of 'mental disconnection' or staring spells lasting a few seconds, without motor convulsions, in a child are classic for Absence Seizures.

================================================================================
Question 574 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25 years old lady was brought by her mother to medical emergency with lower limbs weakness for last 2 days, the cold also pain and numbness in lower limbs. She was also complaining of retention of urine for last 1 day. History of respiratory infection two weeks back. Neurological examination showed signs of upper motor neuron lesion in lower limbs and sensory level at T8. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Guillain Barre Syndrome
✓ Multiple sclerosis
  Poliomyelitis
  Brain abscess
  Conversion disorder

Explanation:
The acute onset of paraplegia with a sensory level (T8), sphincter dysfunction (urinary retention), and upper motor neuron signs points to a spinal cord lesion (Transverse Myelitis). Transverse myelitis is a common first presentation of Multiple Sclerosis or can be post-infectious. Among the options, Multiple Sclerosis is a strong consideration for an acute myelitis, though 'Transverse Myelitis' itself would be a more specific description. GBS is lower motor neuron.

================================================================================
Question 575 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 40 years old female presented with one year history of on and off blurring of vision, on hot flashes, difficulty in swallowing, hoarseness and paresthesia, and needle sensations in the right hand and weakness of the left leg for the last 03 days. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Ischemic Stroke
✓ Multiple Sclerosis
  Oligodendroglioma
  Endocrine disorders
  Trigeminal neuralgia

Explanation:
The history of neurological symptoms separated in time (1 year history vs 3 days) and space (visual, bulbar, sensory in hand, motor in leg) is the hallmark of Multiple Sclerosis.

================================================================================
Question 576 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years old girl was brought to medical emergency with slowly progressive, ascending Paralysis of lower limbs for last one week. Clinical examination showed pulse 110/min, BP 100/70 and respiratory rate 22/min. Power in lower limb was 3/5 and upper limb 5/5. Reflexes were absent and planter were down going. She was treated for Acute upper respiratory tract infection a week ago. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Guillain Barre Syndrome
  Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis
  Poliomyelitis
  Spinal shock after trauma
  Transverse Myelitis

Explanation:
Progressive ascending paralysis with areflexia (absent reflexes) following a respiratory infection is the classic presentation of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).

================================================================================
Question 577 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 25-year-old man is Driven by profession and has been jobless for the last 15 years, presented with a serious suicidal attempt from which he survived and remained admitted in ICU for a week. On mental state examination you found that he is still having serious suicidal ideations because of underlying severe depression episode for which he is already taking Fluoxetine 40 mg and Lithium 800 mg per day. He lives alone and although willing to take treatment but he doesn't want to stay longer in psychiatric unit. Which of the following will be your next strategy for treatment of this acutely suicidal patient?

Options:
  Add small dose of anti-psychotic and discharge
  Add Tricyclic antidepressant and Discharge
  Give advice to stop cannabis and Discharge
✓ Give electro-convulsive therapy if he consents
  Start CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy)

Explanation:
For a patient with severe depression who is acutely suicidal, has already attempted suicide, and is resistant to pharmacotherapy (already on meds), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is the most rapid and effective treatment to reduce suicide risk. Discharging a patient with ongoing serious suicidal ideation who lives alone is unsafe.

================================================================================
Question 578 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 years old man presented to your clinic with increased talk, dis-inhibited behavior, Grandiose delusions, over-religiosity and inability to sleep for the last one month. He sometimes smokes cigarettes and cannabis also. He had similar episode a few years ago and got better with Valproate sodium which he continued for several months. What is the most probable Diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Cannabis dependence
  Schizophrenia
  Epilepsy
✓ Manic episode
  Cannabis intoxication

Explanation:
The symptoms of increased talkativeness, disinhibition, grandiose delusions, and decreased need for sleep are classic for a Manic Episode. The history of a similar episode responding to a mood stabilizer (Valproate) further supports a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (current episode Manic).

================================================================================
Question 579 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
20 years medical student experiences episodes of sudden extreme anxiety with palpitations, restlessness, sweating, body tremors and impending fear of death, which lasts for 20 to 30 minutes and spontaneously recovers without any medication.

His symptoms are well explained by which of the following condition?

Options:
  Death phobia
  Dissociative disorder
  Malingering
✓ Panic disorder
  Thyrotoxicosis

Explanation:
Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks characterized by sudden intense fear and physical symptoms (palpitations, sweating, fear of death) that peak within minutes are the hallmark of Panic Disorder.

Question 581 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A school teacher who has chronic daily headache without any vomiting and his Neuroimaging is clear. He also suffers from increased intra-ocular pressure and glaucoma. He requests you for prophylactic treatment for his headache. Which of the following will be avoided in this patient?

Options:
  Paracetamol
  Propranolol
  Piztofen
✓ Tricyclic antidepressants
  Topiramate

Explanation:
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) like amitriptyline have anticholinergic properties which can dilate the pupil and potentially exacerbate angle-closure glaucoma. Therefore, they should be used with caution or avoided in patients with glaucoma.

================================================================================
Question 582 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A young lady who developed severe headache was given narcotic analgesics for pain relief. She recovered quickly with that and would use the same medicine without any prescription. Gradually she increased the amount of that narcotic analgesic as the same amount of medicine would not give her relief from pain. This phenomenon is called as:

Options:
  Dependence
  Detoxification
  Habituation
  Intoxication
✓ Tolerance

Explanation:
Tolerance is the phenomenon where a larger dose of a drug is required to achieve the same effect that was previously achieved with a smaller dose.

================================================================================
Question 583 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-years-old man is brought with overdose of some drug of abuse. The family doesn't know which drug he is using now a day. On examination you found pin-point pupils, over sedation, dry mouth and shallow breathing. The most likely overdose is because of which drug?

Options:
  Alcohol
  Cannabis
  Cocaine
  Methyl phenidate
✓ Opioids

Explanation:
The triad of pinpoint pupils (miosis), respiratory depression (shallow breathing), and sedation (coma) is the classic toxidrome for Opioid overdose.

================================================================================
Question 584 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
Depression is a common disorder affecting everyone in different stages of life. Mild depression may not need any medication but if the patient has moderate or severe symptoms most of the times on most of the days, he will need to be treated. The symptoms must persist for at least what certain amount of time before we can diagnose it as Depressive episode?

Options:
  At least six months
  At least six weeks
  At least one week
✓ At least two weeks
  At least one month

Explanation:
According to DSM-5 and ICD-10 criteria, symptoms must persist for at least two weeks to diagnose a Major Depressive Episode.

================================================================================
Question 585 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A young girl, age 19 years, presented to hospital with impulsivity, self-injurious behavior, mood swings and Benzodiazepine abuse. She says that everyone dislikes her and nobody is sincere to her. Her older sister adds that she behaves this way since her late childhood and has gradually lost all her friends because of her un-predictable behavior. She reports teeth chattering from which of the following?

Options:
  Adolescence crisis
  Bipolar affective disorder
  Delusional disorder
  Drug addiction
✓ Personality disorder

Explanation:
The long-standing pattern (since late childhood) of impulsivity, unstable relationships, mood swings, self-harm, and unpredictable behavior is characteristic of a Personality Disorder, most likely Borderline Personality Disorder.

================================================================================
Question 586 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
A young patient of 30 years presented to neurosurgery OPD with complaints of pain lower back for the last one month. Which was associated with urinary and bowel incontinence. Patient was also having weakness in both lower limbs and was walking with support. On examination patient was having mixed upper motor neuron signs in both lower limbs and power in both LL was 4/5. Which level of spinal cord might be involved?

Options:
  Cauda equine region
  Cervical cord
✓ Conus area
  Dorsal cord
  Lumbar Cord

Explanation:
Conus medullaris syndrome involves the end of the spinal cord. It typically presents with early bladder/bowel dysfunction (incontinence), and a mix of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs. Cauda equina syndrome is purely LMN. Higher lesions (Dorsal, Cervical) would typically be purely UMN below the level. The 'mixed' signs with early sphincter involvement point to the Conus.

================================================================================
Question 587 (KMC - 2024)
================================================================================

Question:
An old lady aged 60 years presented to emergency department with history of sudden onset of weakness of right side associated with Dysphasia. She was also having weakness on left side of face. On CT scan an irregular glare was ongoing. Where do you think the pathology in brain is?

Options:
✓ Left brain stem
  Left Parietal region
  Right brain stem
  Right Parietal region
  Left Temporal region

Explanation:
Crossed hemiplegia (ipsilateral cranial nerve palsy + contralateral hemiplegia) is the hallmark of a brainstem lesion. Left facial weakness indicates a lesion on the left side of the brainstem (pons/medulla depending on nucleus involved), and right-sided body weakness indicates corticospinal tract involvement before decussation. Dysphasia is usually cortical (left hemisphere), but the 'crossed' signs strongly point to the brainstem. However, Dysphasia is typically a cortical sign. A brainstem lesion causing dysarthria is common, but true dysphasia implies cortex. If the question implies 'crossed signs', it's brainstem. If the facial weakness is UMN (lower face only) it could be cortical. But 'left face' and 'right body' is crossed.

✓ West Nile virus
  Varicella Zoster virus

Explanation:
The clinical picture of an elderly man with fever, headache, confusion, leg weakness, nuchal rigidity, areflexia, tremor, and myoclonus, especially after a summer camp exposure (suggesting mosquito-borne transmission), is highly suspicious for West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis. The CSF findings of a predominantly polymorphonuclear pleocytosis with normal glucose, although viral meningitis typically shows lymphocytic predominance, are also consistent with WNV infection, which can cause significant neutrophil counts, especially early in the course.

Question 719 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year male has headache and fits. On investigation, he has supra tentorial tumor in the occipital lobe. Microscopic examination shows sheets of cells having fried egg appearance and contain chicken wire pattern vessels. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Astrocytoma
  Ependymoma
  Ganglioglioma
  Meningioma
✓ Oligodendroglioma

Explanation:
The histological description of 'fried egg' appearance (round cells with clear halos) and 'chicken wire' capillary pattern are pathognomonic features of an oligodendroglioma. These tumors often present with seizures and can be found in the cerebral hemispheres.

================================================================================
Question 720 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6 years old girl, who is not vaccinated, presented to emergency room with generalized tonic clonic fits. Patient has the history of fever and vomiting for the last 5 days. The grandfather of the patient is suffering from the chronic cough and is taking medication for it for the last 3 months. Emergency treatment was given to the patient. On examination, patient is weak looking with absent BCG scar, Temp of 101 *F and HR: 112/min. 'There was no rash on the body and no organomegaly. CSF showed: Appearance: Straw-coloured Protein: 150 mg/dL Cell Count: 256 Glucose: 35 mg/dL PMN: 35% Lymphocytes: 65%

Options:
  Bacterial Meningitis
  Viral Encephalitis
✓ TBM
  Brain Abscess
  GBS

Explanation:
The patient's history (not vaccinated, grandfather with chronic cough consistent with potential TB exposure, absent BCG scar) coupled with the subacute presentation (fever and vomiting for 5 days, fits), and characteristic CSF findings (straw-colored, elevated protein 150 mg/dL, low glucose 35 mg/dL, and lymphocytic predominance - 65% lymphocytes) are highly suggestive of Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM). TBM often has a more insidious onset than acute bacterial meningitis and distinctive CSF findings.

Question 722 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 6 year old chid presents to you with 7 days history of fever, headache and generalized tonic clonic siezures. On examination sick looking child, positive meningeal signs, temperature 102 degree f, chest bilateral crepts, no visceromegaly, CVS Sl, S2, O. His CSF RE shows Sugar 40mg/dl, Protein 100mg/dl, WBC 50/mm3, Neutrophils 70%, lymphocytes 30%. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Pyogenic Meningitis
  Tuberculous Meningitis
  Viral Meningitis
  Epilepsy
  Space occupying lesion

Explanation:
The CSF findings of decreased glucose, elevated protein, and a predominant neutrophilic pleocytosis (70% neutrophils) in a child with fever, headache, seizures, and meningeal signs are classic indicators of acute bacterial (pyogenic) meningitis. The chest crepts might suggest a primary infectious focus leading to meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 723 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
65 year old man presents with bradykinesia, tremor at rest and muscular rigidity. Physical examination reveal mask like facies. In this patient, biopsy from the following site is most likely to reveal intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions with in neurons?.

Options:
  Basal ganglia
  Caudate nucleus
  Hippocampus
✓ Substantia nigra
  Midbrain

Explanation:
The symptoms of bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscular rigidity, and mask-like facies are characteristic of Parkinson's disease. The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the presence of Lewy bodies (intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions) within neurons, most prominently in the substantia nigra pars compacta.

================================================================================
Question 724 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Following back trauma, a 65 year old woman developed weakness of the right lower extremity and urinary incontinence. Neurological examination demonstrated pastic monoplegia of the right lower extremity, loss of vibration sense, proprioception in the right side below the T6 level, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side below the T6 level. These findings are suggestive of

Options:
✓ Brown-Séquard syndrome
  Syringomyelia
  Subacute combined degeneration of the cord
  Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery
  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Explanation:
This clinical presentation, characterized by ipsilateral (right-sided) motor weakness and loss of dorsal column sensation (vibration and proprioception), along with contralateral (left-sided) loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion (T6), is the classic description of Brown-Séquard syndrome, which results from hemisection of the spinal cord.

================================================================================
Question 725 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a neonatal ICU, a house officer performs a spinal tap on a neonate with fever, neck stiffness and drowsiness. She is suspecting meningitis, what is the most probable microorganism involved?

Options:
  Staph aureus.
✓ Streptococcus
  Mycoplasma
  Proteus
  Vibrio

Explanation:
In neonates, the most common causes of bacterial meningitis are Group B Streptococcus (GBS), Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. 'Streptococcus' in the options most likely refers to Group B Streptococcus, which is a predominant pathogen in neonatal meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 726 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 7 years old boy, who is fully vaccinated, presented to emergency room with generalized tonic clonic fits. Patient has the history of fever and vomiting for the last two days. Emergency treatment was given. On examination, patient was having 102 *F temp and HR: 112/min. There was no rash on the body and no organomegaly. CSFR/E showed: Count: 250 Glucose: 35 mg/dL PMN: 80% Appearance: Turbid Protein: 100 mg/dL Cell Lymphocytes: 20% What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Viral Encephalitis
  TBM
  Brain Abscess
✓ Bacterial Meningitis
  Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

Explanation:
The CSF findings of turbid appearance, elevated WBC count (250/mm3) with a strong neutrophilic predominance (80% PMN), decreased glucose (35 mg/dL), and elevated protein (100 mg/dL) are pathognomonic for acute bacterial meningitis. The clinical presentation of fever, vomiting, and seizures further supports this diagnosis.

================================================================================
Question 727 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 58-year old man has experienced worsening double vision and eyelid dropping, particularly towards the end of the day. He also has had difficulty chewing food and was diagnosed with Sjogren syndrome a decade ago. He had 5/5 motor strength in his extremities that decreases to 4/5 with repetitive movement. Administration of Edrophonium restores muscle strength. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be reported for this patient?

Options:
✓ Acetylcholine receptor antibody positivity
  Anti-histidyl tRNA synthetase (Anti-Jo-1) titer 1: 512
  Elevated serum creatinine kinase level
  Increased serum cortisol level
  Peripheral blood eosinophilia

Explanation:
The clinical picture of worsening ptosis, diplopia, difficulty chewing, fatigability (weakness increasing with repetitive movement), and positive response to Edrophonium (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) is highly characteristic of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, making acetylcholine receptor antibody positivity the most likely laboratory finding. Its association with Sjögren syndrome supports an autoimmune etiology.

================================================================================
Question 728 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 years female diagnosed with Sjögren syndrome presents with fever, fatigue, and weakness. On examination, the patient has periorbital edema, a facial rash, and a rash on her hands (extensor surface). She has proximal muscle weakness with intact reflexes and sensations. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Polymyositis
  Inclusion body myositis
✓ Dermatomyositis
  Amyloidosis
  Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy

Explanation:
The combination of proximal muscle weakness with characteristic skin manifestations such as periorbital edema (heliotrope rash), a facial rash, and a rash on the extensor surfaces of the hands (Gottron's papules) is classic for dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 729 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 year old man comes to A&E with headache, neck stiffness and photo phobia. On Lumbar puncture, he has elevated CSF pressure, elevated protein, increased number of neutrophils and decreased glucose. What is your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Bacterial meningitis
  Fungal meningitis
  Immunologic meningitis
  Parasitic meningitis
  Viral meningitis

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, and CSF findings of elevated pressure, elevated protein, increased neutrophils, and decreased glucose are classic for acute bacterial meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 730 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50 year old man who is HIV positive presents with headache and low grade fever for past 2 weeks. On lumbar puncture he has elevated CSF pressure, increased protein, increased lymphocytes and decreased glucose. What is your most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Bacterial meningitis
  Candidial meningitis
✓ Fungal meningitis
  Protozoal meningitis
  Viral meningitis.

Explanation:
In an HIV-positive patient, a subacute presentation of headache and low-grade fever with CSF findings of elevated pressure, increased protein, increased lymphocytes, and decreased glucose is highly suggestive of fungal meningitis, commonly cryptococcal meningitis. Viral meningitis typically has normal glucose, and bacterial meningitis usually has a more acute onset and often neutrophilic predominance.

================================================================================
Question 731 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency room after a near-drowning accident while boating. The patient has no pulse when the paramedics arrive, but he is resuscitated. The patient never regains consciousness and expires 3 days later. Examination of the brain at autopsy reveals a watershed zone of infarction in the left cerebral hemisphere. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this infarct?

Options:
  Disseminated intravascular coagulation
✓ Prolonged hypo tension
  Saggital sinus thrombosis
  Spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage
  Thromboembolism

Explanation:
A near-drowning accident with cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation implies a period of global cerebral hypoxia and hypoperfusion. Watershed (or border zone) infarcts occur in areas that are supplied by the most distal branches of major cerebral arteries, making them particularly vulnerable to ischemia during episodes of prolonged systemic hypotension.

================================================================================
Question 732 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
48 years old man presents to the clinic complaining of involuntary movements of his arms and legs. He tells you that his mother had similar symptoms, which progressed to dementia. Physical examination reveal involuntary jerky movements and poor concentration. When an MRI Brain demonstrates atrophy of caudate nucleus and putamen as well as dilatation of ventricles, you fear that patient will likely succumb to dementia as his mother. What is the likely diagnosis:

Options:
  Alzheimer's Disease
✓ Huntington disease
  Parkinson disease
  Amylotrophic lateral sclerosis
  Multiple myeloma

Explanation:
The clinical triad of chorea (involuntary jerky movements), psychiatric symptoms (poor concentration, progressing to dementia), and a strong family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance, along with MRI findings of atrophy of the caudate nucleus and putamen with associated ventricular dilation, are pathognomonic for Huntington's disease.

================================================================================
Question 733 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 20 year old man comes to A& E with high grade fever, neck stiffness and photo phobia. On lumbar puncture, the CSF has increased pressure, neutrophils and decreased glucose. What is the most probable diagnosis?

Options:
  Astrocytoma
✓ Fungal meningitis
  Malignancy
  Tumor
  Viral meningitis

Explanation:
The CSF findings of increased pressure, neutrophilic pleocytosis (increased neutrophils), and decreased glucose, along with clinical signs of high fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia, are most characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. However, since 'Bacterial meningitis' is not an option, fungal meningitis can sometimes present with decreased glucose and increased neutrophils, especially in early or acute phases, though lymphocytic predominance is more typical. Therefore, from the given options, fungal meningitis is the most plausible infectious etiology that can have decreased CSF glucose.

================================================================================
Question 734 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 75 year old woman presents 'With chronic severe headache, weight loss, anemia, and aching shoulders. Which test should be performed first?

Options:
✓ Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
  Thyroid-stimulating hormone
  Liver function tests
  Reticulocyte count
  MRI brain

Explanation:
The combination of chronic severe headache, weight loss, anemia, and aching shoulders (suggesting polymyalgia rheumatica-like symptoms) in an elderly woman is highly suspicious for Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis). The most important initial diagnostic test for suspected Giant Cell Arteritis is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is typically markedly elevated.

================================================================================
Question 735 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Microscopic examination of brain tissue taken from autopsy of a patient with clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease reveal central core of amyloid surrounded by collection of neuritic processes? What is the main composition of these amyloid cores?

Options:
  Amyloid associated peptide derived from SAA peptide
  Amyloid derived from prolactonin
  Amyloid derived from trans thyretin
  Amyloid derived from immunoglobulin light chains
✓ B-Amyloid derived from amyloid precursor protein

Explanation:
The characteristic amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease have a central core of amyloid surrounded by dystrophic neuritic processes. The main component of these amyloid cores is beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, which are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

================================================================================
Question 736 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 62-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes presents with sudden onset of weakness. His blood pressure is 200/115 mm Hg, and his pulse is 80 per minute. An X-ray film of the chest demonstrates cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. A CT scan of the brain reveals intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient becomes unresponsive and eventually expires. Which of the following was the most likely site for cerebral hemorrhage in this patient?

Options:
✓ Basal ganglia and thalamic area
  Frontal lobe cortex
  Medulla
  Midbrain
  Hippocampus

Explanation:
In patients with poorly controlled hypertension, intraparenchymal hemorrhages are most commonly caused by the rupture of small penetrating arteries (Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms). The most frequent locations for these hypertensive hemorrhages are the basal ganglia (especially the putamen), thalamus, pons, and cerebellum.

================================================================================
Question 737 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old man comes to A & E after meningitis with high grade fever, confusion and altered mental status. On CT scan he has a lesion in one of the cerebral hemispheres. What is your diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Cerebral Abscess
  Cerebral Malaria
  Granuloma
  Tumor
  Neoplasm

Explanation:
A patient with a history of meningitis who subsequently develops high-grade fever, confusion, altered mental status, and a focal lesion on CT scan (in a cerebral hemisphere) is highly suggestive of the development of a brain (cerebral) abscess, a known complication of bacterial meningitis or other infections.

================================================================================
Question 738 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 54-year-old-woman with a history of splenectomy for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is brought to a local emergency department for lethargy, headache, photophobia, and fever that developed over the course of 6 hours. Examination reveals decreased level of arousal, nuchal rigidity, and petechiae in the trunk, conjunctiva, and palate. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these manifestations?

Options:
  Coxsackievirus
  Staph aureus
  Listeria
✓ Neisseria meningitidis
  Proteus

Explanation:
The acute onset of lethargy, headache, photophobia, fever, nuchal rigidity, and especially the presence of a petechial rash (on trunk, conjunctiva, and palate) are classic signs of meningococcal meningitis caused by *Neisseria meningitidis*. The history of splenectomy renders the patient particularly susceptible to overwhelming sepsis from encapsulated bacteria like *N. meningitidis*.

================================================================================
Question 739 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60 year old woman presents with walking difficulty especially downstairs and standing from sitting position for last 03 months. On examination, she has quadriceps weakness and asymmetric atrophy of her wrist and finger flexors with intact sensations. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Polymyositis
✓ Inclusion body myositis
  Dermatomyositis
  Amyloidosis
  Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy

Explanation:
This clinical presentation, including quadriceps weakness, asymmetric atrophy of wrist and finger flexors, and insidious onset of walking difficulty (especially with stairs and rising from a chair) in an older adult, with intact sensations, is highly characteristic of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). IBM often affects distal muscles and quadriceps asymmetrically, differentiating it from other inflammatory myopathies.

================================================================================
Question 740 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26 year old morbid obese woman presents with generalized persistent headache, transient blurry vision and pulsatile tinnitus.Neurological examination is all normal except for bilateral restricted horizontal eye movements and blurred disc margins. CT and MRI brain done and normal. Which of the following diagnoses should be suspected?

Options:
✓ Intracranial hypertension
  Migraine
  Tension headache
  Venous sinus thrombosis
  Intracranial hypotension

Explanation:
The constellation of generalized persistent headache, transient blurry vision, pulsatile tinnitus, bilateral blurred disc margins (papilledema), and sometimes abducens nerve palsy (restricted horizontal eye movements) in a young, obese woman with otherwise normal CT and MRI scans is classic for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri.

================================================================================
Question 741 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 27 year old man presented to neurology OPD with history of headaches for the past 3 months. Over a 2 week period he has 4 generalized seizures. On physical examination no papilledema or movement disorder is noted. CT scan of the head shows a 2.5 cm mass in the left frontal lobe. Biopsy of the lesion shows a conglomerate of various sized tortuous vessels surrounded by gliosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Angiosarcoma
✓ Arteriovenous malformation
  Multiple sclerosis plaque
  Organizing abscess
  Rupture saccular aneurysm

Explanation:
The clinical picture of chronic headaches, recurrent seizures, a mass lesion on CT, and a biopsy revealing 'a conglomerate of various sized tortuous vessels surrounded by gliosis' is characteristic of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). AVMs are abnormal direct connections between arteries and veins that can lead to seizures, hemorrhage, or mass effect.

================================================================================
Question 742 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old male has developed vertigo. MRI shows a tumor at cerebello-pontine angle. The patient is operated and microscopy of tumor reveal a benign spindle cell lesion containing Antoni A and Antoni B areas. Which of the following gene is affected in this tumor?

Options:
  EGFR
✓ NFI
  PTEN
  P16
  P53

Explanation:
A tumor at the cerebellopontine angle presenting with vertigo, and histologically characterized by Antoni A and Antoni B areas, is typical of a schwannoma (often a vestibular schwannoma or acoustic neuroma). Schwannomas are strongly associated with mutations in the *NF2* gene, which is responsible for Neurofibromatosis type 2. Although option 'NFI' refers to Neurofibromatosis type 1, if it's the only neurofibromatosis-related gene provided, and given the context of a nerve sheath tumor, it might be the intended answer, even if *NF2* is more directly implicated in schwannomas.

================================================================================
Question 743 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 44 year old man developed sudden onset of back pain, followed by flaccid areflexic paraplegia with urinary incontinence.Neurological examination showed loss of sensation to pain and temperature at the T4 level with preservation of vibration and proprioception. These findings are suggestive of

Options:
  Syringomyelia
  Subacute combined degeneration of the cord
✓ Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery
  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
  Tabesdorsalis

Explanation:
The sudden onset of back pain, flaccid areflexic paraplegia, urinary incontinence, and dissociated sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature with preservation of vibration and proprioception) below the T4 level is characteristic of occlusion of the anterior spinal artery. The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, affecting motor and spinothalamic tracts while sparing the posterior columns.

================================================================================
Question 744 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26 year old man presents with a headache that worsens when he stands. He also complains of nausea and photophobia. On examination he is afebrile and his blood pressure is normal. Fundoscopic examination is also normal but does have mild neck stiffness. MRI shows diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement. What is the diagnosis?

Options:
✓ Intracranial hypotension
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage
  Viral meningitis
  Migraine
  Venous sinus thrombosis

Explanation:
A headache that worsens upon standing (orthostatic headache), accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on MRI, is highly characteristic of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), which is often caused by a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.

================================================================================
Question 745 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 58-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for a laparoscopic hernia repair.General anesthesia was induced by intravenous diazepam, and the patient lost consciousness in about 1 minute. He regained consciousness about 35 minutes later. Knowing that the half-life of diazepam is about 40 hours, which of the following items best explains the short action of the drug?

Options:
  Biotransformation of the drug into inactive metabolites
  Development of a rapid tolerance to drug effects
  Rapid excretion of the drug by the kidneys
  Rapid metabolism of the drug within the central nervous system
✓ Redistribution of the drug from central

Explanation:
The short duration of action of highly lipid-soluble drugs like diazepam (when given as a single IV dose for induction) is primarily due to rapid redistribution of the drug from the highly perfused central compartment (brain) to less perfused peripheral tissues (muscle, fat). Despite a long elimination half-life, the drug quickly leaves the brain, leading to a rapid cessation of its acute central effects.

================================================================================
Question 746 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 26-year-old woman discovered she was unexpectedly pregnant. She had been regularly taking an oral contraceptive medication for several years. Two months earlier, she was diagnosed with complex partial seizures and started the prescribed therapy. Which of the following drugs was she most likely taking?

Options:
✓ Carbamazepine
  Clonazepam
  Gabapentin
  Lamotrigine
  Valproic Acid

Explanation:
Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug that is a strong inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes. This enzyme induction can significantly increase the metabolism of oral contraceptive medications, rendering them less effective and increasing the risk of unplanned pregnancy. Among the options, carbamazepine is the classic example of an AED with this interaction.

================================================================================
Question 747 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 47-year-old woman complained to her physician of blurred and double vision. She had Ibeen suffering from a central nervous system disorder and had been receiving a drug treatment for 6 months. Physical examination showed mild hirsutism, broadening of her lips and nose, and thickening and bleeding of her gums. Which of the following drugs most likely caused these adverse effects?

Options:
  Fluoxetine
  Gabapentin
  Lithium
✓ Phenytoin
  Valproic Acid

Explanation:
The constellation of adverse effects including gingival hyperplasia (thickening and bleeding gums), hirsutism (mild hirsutism), and coarse facial features (broadening of lips and nose) are classic side effects associated with chronic phenytoin therapy. Blurred and double vision can also occur as dose-related side effects.

================================================================================
Question 748 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following extra-pyramidal effects seen with antipsychotic agents is also known as "rabbit syndrome"?

Options:
  Acute dystonia reaction
  Akathisia
  Parkinsonian syndrome
✓ Perioral tremor
  Tardive dyskinesia

Explanation:
Perioral tremor, also known as 'rabbit syndrome,' is a type of extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) that can be seen with antipsychotic agents. It is characterized by rapid, rhythmic movements of the lips and mouth, resembling a rabbit chewing. It is distinct from tardive dyskinesia, which involves more complex, involuntary movements.

================================================================================
Question 749 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An HIV patient comes to the physician with fever, neck stiffness and drowsiness. The doctor suspects meningitis after a spinal tap. What is the best treatment?

Options:
  Aspirin
✓ I/V antibiotics
  NSAIDS
  Paracetamol
  Quinidine

Explanation:
In an HIV patient with suspected meningitis (fever, neck stiffness, drowsiness), particularly if bacterial or cryptococcal meningitis is a concern (which is common in immunocompromised patients), immediate intravenous antibiotics (and/or antifungals, depending on specific suspicion) are crucial for treatment. Prompt empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is essential to cover potential bacterial pathogens while awaiting culture results, as bacterial meningitis can be rapidly fatal.

================================================================================
Question 750 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following drugs is used as preanesthetic medication to produce amnesia?

Options:
  Atropine
✓ Diazepam
  Fentanyl
  Omeprazole
  Ranitidine

Explanation:
Benzodiazepines like diazepam and midazolam are commonly used as preanesthetic medications due to their anxiolytic, sedative, and anterograde amnesic effects. They help reduce patient anxiety and prevent memory of the immediate preoperative period.

================================================================================
Question 751 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A man already using one of the following drugs develops headache, flushing, nausea, and vomiting soon after taking alcohol. Which of the following drug was already in his use?

Options:
  Clonazepam
✓ Disulfiram
  Ethosuximide
  Haloperidol
  Imipramine

Explanation:
Disulfiram is a drug used in the treatment of alcohol dependence. It works by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed. This accumulation causes unpleasant symptoms such as headache, flushing, nausea, and vomiting, deterring alcohol consumption.

================================================================================
Question 752 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An eighteen weeks pregnant lady presents with a new onset of generalized seizures. She has had high grade fever a couple of days back due to a urinary tract infection.What medication would be most appropriate in this condition to control her seizures?

Options:
  Carbamazepine
  Lamotrigine
✓ Levetiracetam
  Phenytoin
  Valproic Acid

Explanation:
For new-onset generalized seizures in pregnancy, particularly when other drugs might have higher teratogenic risks, Levetiracetam is often considered a first-line choice due to its relatively favorable safety profile during pregnancy. Valproic acid and carbamazepine have higher teratogenic risks (neural tube defects). Phenytoin also has teratogenic potential.

================================================================================
Question 753 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old man had been suffering from a central nervous system disorder for many years. Recently, a barbiturate was added to his pharmacotherapy. Which of the following central nervous system effects was most likely elicited by that drug?

Options:
  Analgesic
✓ Anticonvulsants
  Antidepressants
  Antiparkinson
  Antipsychotic

Explanation:
Barbiturates are potent CNS depressants that have a wide range of effects, including sedation, hypnosis, and anticonvulsant activity. While some barbiturates historically had other uses, their primary therapeutic application relevant to a CNS disorder (especially chronic) would often be for their anticonvulsant properties in seizure management.

================================================================================
Question 754 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient physically dependent on an opioid agonist is brought to the emergency department with insomnia, anxiety, rhinorrhea, lacrimation and mydriasis 12 hours after the last dose. Which one of the following drugs will exacerbate these withdrawal symptoms?

Options:
  Acetaminophen
  Codeine
  Diazepam
  Methadone
✓ Naltrexone

Explanation:
The symptoms described (insomnia, anxiety, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, mydriasis) are characteristic of opioid withdrawal. Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist. Administering naltrexone to a physically dependent individual would rapidly displace opioids from their receptors, thereby acutely and severely exacerbating withdrawal symptoms.

Question 755 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 16-year-old girl brought by ambulance to the emergency department was diagnosed with status epilepticus and was given an intravenous injection of a drug that binds to the a-subunit of the GABA-A receptor complex. Which of the following drugs was most likely administered?

Options:
  Flumazenil
✓ Lorazepam
  Phenytoin
  Valproic Acid
  Zolpidem

Explanation:
Status epilepticus is a medical emergency requiring rapid intervention. Intravenous benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam (or diazepam/midazolam), are the first-line treatment. Benzodiazepines bind to specific sites on the GABA-A receptor complex (often involving the alpha subunit) to enhance GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission, thereby stopping seizure activity.

================================================================================
Question 756 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Allergic reactions recurring during the immediate post operative period are most commonly attributed to administration of:

Options:
✓ Muscle Relaxants
  Local Anesthetics
  Antibiotics
  Opioids
  Anti- emetics.

Explanation:
Neuromuscular blocking agents (muscle relaxants) are a common cause of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions during the immediate postoperative period. While other agents can cause allergic reactions, muscle relaxants are particularly noted for this risk in the perioperative setting.

================================================================================
Question 757 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Drug of choice in absence seizures is

Options:
  Phenobabrbitone
  Sodium valproate
✓ Ethosuximide
  lamotrigine
  Topimarate

Explanation:
Ethosuximide is considered the first-line drug of choice for absence seizures (petit mal seizures). It works by blocking T-type calcium channels in the thalamus, which are involved in generating the characteristic 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges of absence seizures.

================================================================================
Question 758 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 59-year-old man underwent surgery to repair an inguinal hernia. Lorazepam was administered as preanesthetic medication.General anesthesia was induced by propofol and maintained with halothane and nitrous oxide. Ondansetron was also given to prevent vomiting. Fifteen minutes after starting the operation, the electrocardiogram monitor showed ventricular tachycardia. Which of the drugs most likely caused this adverse effect?

Options:
✓ Halothane
  C. Nitrous Oxide
  Lorazepam
  Ondansetron
  Propofol

Explanation:
Halothane is known to sensitize the myocardium to circulating catecholamines, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, particularly in the presence of exogenous catecholamines or sympathetic stimulation. This is a well-documented adverse effect of halothane.

================================================================================
Question 759 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for reduction of a dislocated shoulder. Sedation with diazepam was supplemented with a 30% concentration of nitrous oxide. Which of the following effects most likely occurred after nitrous oxide administration?

Options:
  Excellent skeletal muscle relaxation
  Profound respiratory depression
  Rapidly achieved unconsciousness
  Sharp decrease in blood pressure
✓ Very pronounced analgesia

Explanation:
Nitrous oxide is a weak anesthetic but a potent analgesic. Even at relatively low concentrations (like 30%), it can provide significant analgesia, making it useful as an adjunct to other sedative or anesthetic agents, such as for painful procedures like shoulder reduction.

================================================================================
Question 760 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 75-year-old woman was undergoing cystoscopy for a suspected papilloma of the bladder. Before the procedure, the anesthesiologist administered alprazolam to induce conscious sedation and to avoid situational anxiety. When the cystoscopy was over, flumazenil was administered. Which of the following terms best defines the mode of action

Options:
✓ Competitive Antagonist
  Full agonist
  Functional antagonist
  Inverse agonist
  Partial agonist

Explanation:
Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine. Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA-A receptor. It reverses the effects of benzodiazepines by competing for the same binding site without activating the receptor itself.

================================================================================
Question 761 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 63-year-old woman complained to her physician of difficulty in falling asleep. She denied nocturnal insomnia or early awaking. The doctor prescribed ramelteon, one tablet at bedtime. Which of the following molecular actions most likely mediated the therapeutic effect of the drug?

Options:
  Activation of GABA receptors
✓ Activation of melatonin receptors
  Activation of serotonin 5-HT3 receptors
  Blockade of alpha-I (a-I) receptors
  Blockade of glutamate receptors

Explanation:
Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist. It selectively binds to and activates MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, mimicking the effects of endogenous melatonin to regulate sleep-wake cycles and promote sleep onset.

================================================================================
Question 762 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 4-year-old girl who had been suffering from severe asthma for 6 months was scheduled for a short suture procedure that was anticipated to take approximately 10 minutes. She was brought to the operating room by her parents and was in distress over parting from them and afraid of the doctors. Which of the following drugs would be appropriate for providing sedation and analgesia for this girl?

Options:
  Fentanyl
  Halothane
✓ Ketamine
  Sevoflurane
  Thiopental

Explanation:
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that provides both sedation and analgesia. It is particularly useful in pediatric patients and those with asthma because it has bronchodilatory properties, making it a safer choice than some other anesthetics in patients with reactive airway disease.

================================================================================
Question 763 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12-year-old boy who was recently diagnosed with absence seizures started a therapy with ethosuximide. Which of the following molecular actions most likely mediated the therapeutic efficacy of the drug in the patient's disorder?

Options:
  Activation of GABA-A receptors
  Blockade of ligand-gated Na+ channels
  Blockade of NMDA receptors
✓ Blockade of T-type Ca2+ channels
  Opening of voltage gated K+ channels

Explanation:
Ethosuximide is the drug of choice for absence seizures, and its therapeutic efficacy is primarily mediated by selective blockade of T-type calcium channels in the thalamus. This action reduces the abnormal rhythmic electrical activity characteristic of absence seizures.

================================================================================
Question 764 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with suspected poisoning was brought to the emergency department with vomiting and staggering gate, on examination pupils were dilated, skin was dry and temperature was raised, he had difficulty in talking. He tried to grasp imaginary objects and tried to pull imaginary threads from the tips of his fingers. Which of the following is the appropriate antidote therapy for this patient?

Options:
  Atropine
  Barbiturates
  Naloxone
✓ Physostigmine
  Pralidoxime chloride

Explanation:
The symptoms described—dilated pupils, dry skin, fever, difficulty talking, visual hallucinations (grasping imaginary objects, pulling imaginary threads)—are classic signs of anticholinergic toxicity, often referred to as the 'anticholinergic toxidrome' (e.g., 'hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, mad as a hatter'). Physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier, is the specific antidote to reverse both central and peripheral anticholinergic effects.

================================================================================
Question 765 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 34-year-old male patient who was prescribed citalopram for depression has decided he wants to stop taking the drug.When questioned, he said that it was affecting his sexual performance. You ascertain that he is also trying to overcome his dependency on tobacco products. If you decide to reinstitute drug therapy in this patient, the best choice would be

Options:
✓ Bupropion
  Fluoxetine
  Imipramine
  Paroxetine
  Venlafaxine

Explanation:
Bupropion is an antidepressant that works by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. It is associated with a lower incidence of sexual dysfunction compared to SSRIs (like citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine) and SNRIs (like venlafaxine). Additionally, bupropion is also indicated for smoking cessation, making it an excellent choice for this patient who is trying to overcome tobacco dependency.

================================================================================
Question 766 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Addition of adrenaline to a solution of lidocaine for a peripheral nerve block will:

Options:
  Decrease the duration of action of lidocaine
  Decrease the risk of seizures due to lidocaine
✓ Increase 'the duration of action of lidocaine
  Increase the maximum efficacy of lidocaine
  Increase the potency of lidocaine

Explanation:
Adrenaline (epinephrine) is a vasoconstrictor often added to local anesthetic solutions like lidocaine. By causing local vasoconstriction, adrenaline reduces the rate of absorption of the local anesthetic from the injection site into the systemic circulation. This prolongs the duration of action of lidocaine at the nerve, allows a larger total dose to be administered safely, and reduces systemic toxicity.

================================================================================
Question 767 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
"Flash backs" are observed in:

Options:
  Cannabis poisoning
  Cocaine poisoning
  Datura poisoning
✓ LSD psychosis
  Hashish Insanity

Explanation:
Flashbacks, formally known as Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD), are a characteristic phenomenon associated with hallucinogenic drugs, particularly LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide). They involve transient recurrences of drug-induced visual disturbances or altered perceptions long after the drug's effects have worn off.

================================================================================
Question 768 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Number of women in Lahore newly diagnosed with heart disease in 2022 divided by estimated number of women living in Lahore on July 1, 2022 This fraction is an example of:

Options:
✓ Incidence rate
  Point prevalence.
  Period prevalence
  Mortality rate
  Case fatality rate

Explanation:
Incidence rate is a measure of the frequency of new cases of a disease in a population at risk over a specified period. The numerator is the number of new cases (newly diagnosed with heart disease), and the denominator is the population at risk (estimated number of women) during that time (in 2022). This perfectly matches the definition of an incidence rate.

================================================================================
Question 769 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Asad, a 25-year-old hiker, encountered a rabid raccoon while camping in a forest. During the encounter, he received a bite on his arm from the rabid raccoon but managed to avoid a full puncture. What is the most appropriate and comprehensive post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for Asad?

Options:
  Immediate administration of a tetanus shot and close monitoring of his condition
  Waiting for any signs of rabies symptoms to appear, then starting PEP if necessary
  Thoroughly washing the exposed wound and observing for 7 days
✓ Immediate administration of rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin (RIG)
  Initiating prophylactic antibiotics and administering a single dose of rabies vaccine

Explanation:
For a category III exposure (transdermal bites or scratches from a confirmed or suspected rabid animal, involving breach of skin), the most appropriate and comprehensive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies includes both passive immunization (Rabies Immune Globulin - RIG, infiltrated into and around the wound) and active immunization (rabies vaccine series). Immediate and thorough wound washing is also critical but is only one component of comprehensive PEP.

================================================================================
Question 770 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A number of passengers on a ship from Pakistan to the Saudia Arabia have recently developed a gastrointestinal illness compatible with norovirus (formerly called Norwalk-like virus). Testing for norovirus is not available. Assuming you are the epidemiologist called on to board the ship and investigate this possible outbreak, your case definition should include, at a minimum:

Options:
  Probable cases
  Suspected cases
✓ Clinical criteria, plus specification of time, place, and person
  Clinical features, plus the exposure(s) you most suspect
  The nationally agreed standard case definition for disease reporting

Explanation:
A robust case definition for an outbreak investigation must include clinical criteria (symptoms or lab results, even if presumptive), and clear specifications of time (when the illness occurred), place (where it occurred, e.g., the ship), and person (who was affected, e.g., passengers). This helps to precisely identify cases for accurate analysis.

================================================================================
Question 771 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
To study the causes of an outbreak of aflatoxin poisoning in Africa, investigators conducted a case- control study with 40 case-patients and 80 controls. Among the 40 poisoning victims, 32 reported storing their maize inside rather than outside. Among the 80 controls, 20 stored their maize inside. The resulting odds ratio for the association between inside storage of maize and illness is:

Options:
  3.2
  5.2
✓ 12.0
  33.3
  44.3

Explanation:
For a case-control study, the Odds Ratio (OR) is calculated using a 2x2 table: (a*d) / (b*c). Let's construct the table: |           | Cases (Ill) | Controls (Not Ill) | |-----------|-------------|--------------------| | Exposed (Inside Storage) | a = 32      | b = 20             | | Not Exposed (Outside Storage) | c = 40-32 = 8 | d = 80-20 = 60 | OR = (32 * 60) / (20 * 8) = 1920 / 160 = 12.0

================================================================================
Question 772 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A Women's Health Study, in which researchers enrolled 41,837 women in 1986 and collected exposure and lifestyle information to assess the relationship between these factors and subsequent occurrence of cancer. It is an example of which type of study?

Options:
  Experimental
✓ Cohort
  Case-control
  Clinical trial
  Case-series

Explanation:
This is a classic example of a prospective cohort study. Researchers enroll a group of individuals (cohort) who are initially disease-free, collect information on exposures, and then follow them over time to observe the incidence of disease (subsequent occurrence of cancer). Since the enrollment and exposure collection happened in 1986, and they are looking for subsequent cancer, it's a cohort study.

================================================================================
Question 773 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Many of the students at the boarding school, including 6 just coming down with varicella, went home during the winter break. About 2 weeks later, 4 siblings of these 6 students (out of a total of 10 siblings) developed varicella. The secondary attack rate among siblings was, therefore,

Options:
  4/6
✓ 4/10
  4/16
  6/10
  4/20

Explanation:
The secondary attack rate (SAR) is calculated among susceptible contacts. In this scenario, there were 10 siblings in total. It is implied that these 10 siblings were exposed to the 6 students with varicella. The 4 siblings who developed varicella are the new cases among the contacts. Assuming all 10 siblings were susceptible (no prior immunity mentioned), SAR = (Number of secondary cases / Total number of susceptible contacts) = 4 / 10.

================================================================================
Question 774 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a survey of 10,000 IV drug abusers in town A, 1,000 turn out to be infected with hepatitis C and 500 infected with hepatitis B. During two years of follow-up, 200 patients with hepatitis C infection and 100 patients with hepatitis B infection die. Also during follow- up, 200 IV drug abusers acquire hepatitis C and 50 acquire hepatitis B. Which of the following is the best estimate of the annual incidence of hepatitis C infection in IV drug abusers in town A?

Options:
  1000/10000
  1100/10000
  100/10000
✓ 100/9000
  100/9800

Explanation:
Incidence refers to the rate of *new* cases. For hepatitis C, 200 IV drug abusers *acquire* hepatitis C during two years of follow-up. This means an average of 100 new cases per year (200 cases / 2 years). The denominator for incidence is the population *at risk* (those not already infected). Initial population = 10,000. Initial hepatitis C infected = 1,000. Population at risk = 10,000 - 1,000 = 9,000. So, the annual incidence rate of hepatitis C is 100 new cases / 9,000 persons at risk.

================================================================================
Question 775 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The physical examination records of the incoming first-year class of 1935 at the University of Minnesota are examined in 1980 to see whether the freshmen's recorded height and weight at the time of admission to the university were related to their chance of developing coronary heart disease by 1981. Identify the study design.

Options:
  Case Control
  Prospective cohort
✓ Retrospective cohort
  Clinical Trial
  Ecological

Explanation:
This is a retrospective cohort study (or historical cohort study). The cohort (the 1935 class) was defined based on past records (physical examination in 1935). Their exposure status (height and weight) was recorded at that past time. The researchers then looked forward in time (to 1981) using existing records to determine the outcome (coronary heart disease). Although the data collection happened in the present (1980), the cohort itself and the initial exposure data were from the past.

================================================================================
Question 776 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A person had received full course of anti- rabies vaccine one and a half years back.Now he was bitten by a stray dog. what is the most appropriate option to protect that person against rabies? (there is no facility to check the rabies neutralizing antibodies).

Options:
  Anti-rabies immunoglobulin within 24 hours
✓ Cell culture vaccine one intramuscular injection on day 0 and second injection on day 3
  Full coarse of 5 injections of cell culture vaccine
  Give both active and passive immunization
  No vaccine is required because person is already vaccinated

Explanation:
For a previously vaccinated individual (who has completed a full course of rabies vaccine), if re-exposed to rabies, the recommended post-exposure prophylaxis is a booster regimen of two doses of rabies vaccine (on Day 0 and Day 3), without the need for Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG). The prior vaccination provides a memory immune response that is rapidly boosted by these two doses.

================================================================================
Question 777 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In 2001, a total of 15,555 homicide deaths occurred among males and 4,753 homicide deaths occurred among females. The estimated 2001 midyear populations for males and females were 139,813,000 and 144,984,000, respectively. Calculate the homicide-related death rates for males.

Options:
  9.1 homicide deaths / 100,000 population among males
✓ 11.1 homicide deaths / 100,000 population among males
  13.1 homicide deaths / 100,000 population among males
  15.1 homicide deaths / 100,000 population among males
  17.1 homicide deaths / 100,000 population among males

Explanation:
Homicide-related death rate for males is calculated as (Number of male homicide deaths / Estimated midyear male population) * 100,000. Rate = (15,555 / 139,813,000) * 100,000 ≈ 0.00011125 * 100,000 ≈ 11.125 per 100,000 population among males. Therefore, 11.1 is the closest answer.

================================================================================
Question 778 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The prevalence of mental disorders is one of the important health problem worldwide. According to WHO what proportion of people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point of their lives?

Options:
✓ 20/0

Explanation:
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a significant proportion of the global population is affected by mental or neurological disorders. The exact figures vary by specific disorder and lifetime prevalence versus point prevalence. However, the WHO often cites figures around 1 in 4 (25%) or 1 in 5 (20%) adults experiencing a mental health condition in a given year, and the lifetime prevalence is higher. The option '20/0' is likely a typo for 20%, but the question phrasing 'at some point of their lives' suggests lifetime prevalence, which is often higher than 20% for a broad category of mental or neurological disorders. Without a precise match for a common WHO statistic from the garbled option, a definitive answer from the provided list is difficult.

================================================================================
Question 779 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 10 year old child admitted in ICU with 1 month history of fever and irritability. A week back he developed sudden onset of GTC fitz with loss of consviousness. He was admitted in tertiary care hospital where qas diagnosed as a case of TBM on MRI amd CSF R/E. He responded to the treatment well. Attendants ask you how long will the ATT medications be continued.

Options:
✓ 12 months
  9 months
  6 months
  18 months
  10 months

Explanation:
The standard duration of antituberculosis treatment (ATT) for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is typically longer than for pulmonary tuberculosis, often recommended for a total of 9 to 12 months, and sometimes even up to 18 months, depending on severity and response. Given the options, 12 months is a common and appropriate duration for TBM treatment.

================================================================================
Question 780 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The incidence of diabetes mellitus in a population with very little migration has remained stable over the past 40 years (55 cases per 1000 people per year). At the same time, prevalence of the disease increased threefold over the same period. Which of the following is the best explanation for the changes in diabetes occurrence measures in the population?

Options:
  Increased diagnostic accuracy
  Poor event ascertainment
✓ Improved quality of care
  Increased overall morbidity
  Loss at follow-up

Explanation:
Prevalence is influenced by both incidence and duration of disease. If incidence remains stable but prevalence increases, it means that people with the disease are living longer. Improved quality of care (better treatments, management of complications) would allow individuals with diabetes to live longer with the disease, thus increasing its prevalence even if the rate of new diagnoses (incidence) is stable.

================================================================================
Question 781 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 52-year-old Caucasian female presents to your office with a self-palpated thyroid nodule. After the appropriate work-up, fine- needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule is performed. The FNA result is negative. As you are explaining the test result, the patient asks, "What are the chances that I really do not have cancer?" You reply that the probability of thyroid cancer is low in her case because FNA has a high:

Options:
  Specificity
  Sensitivity
  Positive predictive value
✓ Negative predictive value
  Validity

Explanation:
The Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of a test is the probability that an individual truly does not have the disease, given that their test result is negative. If an FNA is negative and the patient asks about the chances of *not* having cancer, a high NPV means that a negative result reliably rules out the disease, reassuring the patient of a low probability of cancer.

================================================================================
Question 782 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A serologic test is being devised to detect a hypothetical chronic disease. Three hundred individuals were referred to a laboratory for testing. One hundred diagnosed cases were among the 300. A serologic test yielded 200 positives, of which one fourth were true positives. Calculate the sensitivity of this test. (After setting up the appropriate 2 by 2 table, find missing data by subtraction)

Options:

Explanation:
Let's construct the 2x2 table: |           | Disease Present | Disease Absent | Total | |-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------| | Test Positive | True Positive (TP) | False Positive (FP) | 200   | | Test Negative | False Negative (FN) | True Negative (TN) |       | | Total     | 100             |                | 300   | Given: Total individuals = 300. Diagnosed cases (Disease Present) = 100. So, Disease Absent = 300 - 100 = 200. Test yielded 200 positives. One fourth (1/4) of these were true positives. So, TP = 1/4 * 200 = 50. From the 'Disease Present' column: TP + FN = 100. So, FN = 100 - TP = 100 - 50 = 50. Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 50 / (50 + 50) = 50 / 100 = 0.5 or 50%.

================================================================================
Question 783 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In 2020, a total of 15,555 homicide deaths occurred among males and 4,753 homicide deaths occurred among females. The estimated 2020 midyear populations for males and females were 139,813,000 and 144,984,000, respectively. What type(s) of mortality rates can you calculate from above scenario?

Options:
  Proportionate and cause specific mortality.
  Proportionate and area specific mortality.
  Cause and age-specific mortality rates
  Cause and race-specific mortality rates
✓ Cause and sex-specific mortality rates

Explanation:
From the given data (number of homicide deaths for males and females, and midyear populations for males and females), you can calculate cause-specific mortality rates (for homicide) and sex-specific mortality rates (by calculating rates separately for males and females). Age and race information is not provided.

================================================================================
Question 784 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You are investigating the role of physical activity in heart disease, and your data suggest a protective effect. While presenting your findings, a colleague asks whether you have thought about confounders, such as factor X. Under which of the following conditions could this factor have confounded your interpretation of the data?

Options:
  It is a risk factor for some other disease, but not heart disease.
✓ It is a risk factor associated with the physical activity measure and heart disease.
  It is part of the causal pathway by which physical activity affects heart disease.
  It has caused a lack of follow-up of test subjects.
  It may have blinded your study.

Explanation:
A confounding factor (Factor X) is a variable that distorts the true relationship between an exposure (physical activity) and an outcome (heart disease). For a factor to be a confounder, it must be (1) associated with the exposure, (2) a risk factor for the outcome (independent of the exposure), and (3) not be an intermediate step in the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome. Option (b) perfectly describes these first two criteria, which are essential for confounding.

================================================================================
Question 785 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Sarah, a veterinarian, was treating an injured dog that was brought into her clinic. During the examination, the dog unexpectedly bit her on the hand. A few days later, she started experiencing symptoms. What is the most common mode of transmission for rabies in Sarah's case?

Options:
  Ingestion of contaminated food or water
  Sexual contact with an infected individual
  Airborne respiratory droplets
✓ Direct contact with saliva from an infected animal through a bite or scratch
  Blood transfusion from an infected donor

Explanation:
Rabies is almost exclusively transmitted through direct contact with saliva from an infected animal, typically via a bite that breaks the skin or, less commonly, through a scratch or licking of mucous membranes. This is the classic mode of transmission in cases like Sarah's.

================================================================================
Question 786 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
British investigators conducted a study to compare measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine history among 1,294 children with pervasive development disorder (e.g., autism and Asperger's syndrome) and 4,469 children without such disorders. (They found no association.) This is an example of which type of study?

Options:
  Experimental
  Cohort
✓ Case-control
  Clinical trial
  Case-series

Explanation:
This is a case-control study. Researchers identified a group of 'cases' (children with pervasive development disorder) and a group of 'controls' (children without such disorders). They then looked retrospectively at their past exposure (MMR vaccine history) to see if there was an association. The outcome (disorder) is determined first, and then past exposure is ascertained.

================================================================================
Question 787 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Several tests have been developed to measure serologic markers of breast cancer.The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of early stage breast cancer vary from test to test. If positive, which of the following tests will have the highest predictive value for the disease?

Options:
  Sensitivity-80%, specificity - 90%
✓ Sensitivity-65%, specificity - 97%
  Sensitivity-70%, specificity - 94%
  Sensitivity-75%, specificity-92%
  Sensitivity-85%, specificity-90%

Explanation:
Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is directly related to a test's specificity and the prevalence of the disease. While higher sensitivity and specificity generally improve predictive values, specificity has a stronger influence on PPV, especially when the disease prevalence is low. Among the given options, the test with the highest specificity (97%) will generally yield the highest positive predictive value.

Question 788 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The entire population of a given community is examined, and all who are judged free of bowel cancer are questioned extensively about their diet. These people are then followed for several years to see whether their eating habits will predict their risk of developing bowel cancer. Identify the type of study design.

Options:
  Case Control
  Cross sectional
✓ Prospective cohort
  Retrospective cohort
  Clinical Trial

Explanation:
This is a prospective cohort study. A cohort (the population free of bowel cancer) is identified. Information on exposures (diet/eating habits) is collected. Then, the cohort is followed forward in time (for several years) to observe the development of the outcome (bowel cancer).

================================================================================
Question 789 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A study in which children are randomly assigned to receive either a newly formulated vaccine or the currently available vaccine and are followed to monitor for side effects and effectiveness of each vaccine. It is an example of which type of study?

Options:
✓ Experimental
  Observational
  Cohort
  Case-control
  Case-series

Explanation:
Randomly assigning participants to different intervention groups (receiving different vaccines) and then following them to monitor outcomes (side effects and effectiveness) is the defining characteristic of an experimental study, specifically a randomized controlled trial (which is a type of experimental study).

================================================================================
Question 790 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Number of women in town of Peshawar who reported having heart disease in recent health survey divided by estimated number of women residents of Peshawar during same period. This fraction is an example of:

Options:
  Incidence proportion
  Incidence rate
✓ Prevalence
  Mortality rate
  Cause specific mortality rate.

Explanation:
Prevalence is the proportion of a population that has a specific disease or attribute at a given point in time or over a period. In this case, 'reported having heart disease in a recent health survey' represents existing cases, and it is divided by the total population (women residents) during that same period, which is the definition of prevalence.

================================================================================
Question 791 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You are called to see a 18 year old young woman in the emergency department. She was admitted following taking an overdose of multiple tablets at home following an argument with her mother. Her family tells you that she has a history of taking overdoses and cutting herself on numerous occasions in the past. She only has 1-2 close friends and seems to not get along with most people. She is described as extremely moody and easily irritable. What would be your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Antisocial personality
✓ Borderline personality
  Dissocial personality
  Narcissistic personality
  Schizotypal personality

Explanation:
The clinical picture of recurrent suicidal gestures/self-harm (taking overdoses, cutting herself), unstable interpersonal relationships (few friends, not getting along with people), marked mood swings (extremely moody, easily irritable), and impulsivity (overdose after argument) are classic features of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

================================================================================
Question 792 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You see a 26yr old female, university student in your clinics. Her family reports that she has not been engaging well with them, her husband or her family. Her husband states that she has been acting quite bizarre, with reduction in her self-care and hygiene. She has been isolating herself and at times is found to be chanting religious scriptures in a loud voice. She seems to be preoccupied with "the evil eye" and black magic. Her symptoms have been of an acute onset and the only stressor, the family can identify are the birth of her child two weeks ago. What is your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Panic attacks
  Paranoid schizophrenia
  Personality disorder
✓ Post-partum psychosis
  Post-traumatic stress disorder

Explanation:
The acute onset of severe psychotic symptoms (bizarre behavior, self-neglect, isolation, chanting, delusions of 'evil eye'/'black magic') shortly after childbirth (within 2-4 weeks) is highly characteristic of postpartum psychosis. This is a severe psychiatric emergency requiring immediate attention.

================================================================================
Question 793 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Stress is a condition or feeling experienced when a person perceives that "demands exceed the personal resources the individual is able to mobilize." Stress by itself is not necessarily considered something bad - it all depends on how one takes it. When one does experience higher levels of it, we tend to develop certain symptoms such as,

Options:
  Beliefs that people are interfering with our mind/body in some way and controlling our thoughts
  Feeling happy, more productive, energetic, social and able to take multiple projects at once
  Increased sex drive, overspending, grandiosity, increased risk taking and odd religious thoughts
✓ Memory problems, inability to concentrate, focusing on the negatives and increased loneliness.

Explanation:
While stress can manifest in many ways, high levels of chronic stress commonly lead to cognitive and emotional symptoms such as memory problems, inability to concentrate, a tendency to focus on negative aspects, and feelings of loneliness or social withdrawal.

================================================================================
Question 794 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You are asked to review a 18year old college student who has been brought to you by his family. They report him to be very suspicious and constantly preoccupied with conspiracy theories. He feels that the illuminati control the world and all the economies and has claimed that he has been in touch with them through the dark web. He tells you that the heads of the illuminati have secret meetings all over the world where they plan their next moves of world domination. What would be your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Antisocial personality disorder
  Histrionic personality disorder
  Narcissistic personality disorder
  Obsessive personality disorder
✓ Paranoid personality disorder

Explanation:
The patient's pervasive pattern of suspiciousness, preoccupation with conspiracy theories, and feeling that external entities (Illuminati) are controlling world events and communicating with him, are characteristic features of Paranoid Personality Disorder. These are often fixed and unshakeable beliefs, leading to a mistrust of others.

================================================================================
Question 795 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You see a middle-aged gentleman in your clinic. He appears very irritated and constantly talks over you. He does not understand why he has been brought to the hospital by his family, but feels that this can be because of all the I"billions" he has recently inherited from the queen. He believes he is the legitimate heir to the British throne and that is why he needs to hide from everyone including the media. His family report that he has not been sleeping and has been constantly scribbling on pieces of paper at home. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute confusional state
  Acute stress reaction
✓ Bipolar disorder current episode - manic
  Bipolar disorder current episode - hypomanic
  Paranoid schizophrenia

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of irritation, pressured speech (talking over others), grandiosity (delusions of being heir to the British throne, inheriting billions), decreased need for sleep, and increased goal-directed activity (scribbling) are classic features of a manic episode. The combination of these with a likely history (implied by family bringing him) points to Bipolar Disorder, current episode manic.

================================================================================
Question 796 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Arsalan is a 47-year-old man who comes to you for help at the urging of his fiancée. He left the army after serving the country for almost 25 years of his life. His fiancé has told him he has "not been the same since his last posting to a sensitive area and it is impacting their relationship. He is reluctant to share many details of his previous assignments in the military, but describes difficulty sleeping, nightmares, irritability, loss of interests and feeling very jumpy and fearful at times. What would be your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute stress disorder
  Adjustment disorder
  Dis-inhibited social engagement disorder
✓ Post-Traumatic Stress disorder/PTSD
  Reactive attachment disorder

Explanation:
The patient's history of military service in a sensitive area, and symptoms of difficulty sleeping, nightmares, irritability, loss of interests, and hypervigilance (jumpy and fearful), particularly when these symptoms persist for more than one month, are highly characteristic of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

================================================================================
Question 797 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Peer pressure is considered to be one of the most important cause of drug addiction. Among the choices given below which one signifies the meaning of "peer pressure"?

Options:
  Addiction prone personality
  Easy availability of narcotics
✓ Influence of colleagues & friends
  Stress & family pressure
  Personality disorder

Explanation:
Peer pressure refers to the direct or indirect influence exerted by one's age group or social peers, often leading an individual to conform to the attitudes, values, or behaviors of the group. In the context of drug addiction, this is commonly seen as the 'influence of colleagues & friends' to try or use drugs.

================================================================================
Question 798 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You see a 48 year old male on the medical ward, who claims that the army is out to get him. He believes that he had been working with America's intelligence agency and had state secrets that very considered very sensitive. He feels that the army personal have changed their appearance and he sees them working in the local general store regularly. He denies any hallucinations or any thought interference. He does not seem to be elated in his presentation. What would be your likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute psychotic episode
  Bipolar affective disorder
✓ Delusional disorder
  Drug induced psychosis
  Paranoid schizophrenia

Explanation:
The patient's fixed, false belief that the army is persecuting him because of his past intelligence work (persecutory delusions), his belief that army personnel have changed their appearance and are watching him, without clear evidence of prominent hallucinations, thought disorder, or mood disturbance (like elation), is highly suggestive of Delusional Disorder, persecutory type. In schizophrenia, more pervasive thought disorder and prominent hallucinations are usually present.

================================================================================
Question 799 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You see a young boy of 12 years of age. His aunt has accompanied him to the clinic and describes an inability to express emotional or physical attachment to others in him. He shows a disinterest in physical or emotional comfort when distressed or a lack of responsive emotions. What would be your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute stress disorder
  Adjustment disorder
  Dis-inhibited social engagement disorder
  Post-Traumatic Stress disorder/PTSD
✓ Reactive attachment disorder

Explanation:
The description of a child showing an inability to express emotional or physical attachment, disinterest in comfort when distressed, and a lack of responsive emotions (emotional withdrawal) are key diagnostic criteria for Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD). This disorder typically arises from a pattern of extreme insufficient care in early childhood.

================================================================================
Question 800 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Pathological loss of memory and filling the gaps with imaginary thoughts refers to:

Options:
  Delirium
  Delusion
  Illusion
✓ Confabulation
  Hallucination

Explanation:
Confabulation is a memory disturbance characterized by the production of fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, without a conscious intention to deceive. It is a common feature in conditions involving significant memory loss, such as Korsakoff's syndrome, where individuals fill in memory gaps with made-up information.

================================================================================
Question 801 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 31 year old women present to the emergency department with a 1 hour history of sudden onset sever , diffuse headache and vomiting. She has no past medical history. Her observations are recorded as.

Options:
  Heart rate 89 breaths per minute
  Blood pressure.145/89 mmHg
  Respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute
  Temperature. 36.9 C
✓ None of the above

Explanation:
This question is a lead-in to a subsequent question about management. The current question only presents clinical findings. None of the options (a-d) is a direct 'question' or a definitive diagnosis based solely on the provided information, but rather a set of observed vital signs, all of which appear within normal ranges except perhaps for a slightly elevated BP. The question 'Her observations are recorded as' and then listed observations means it is a statement, not a query seeking a diagnosis or interpretation from the list itself. The actual question seems to be 'What is the next step in your management plan for this patient?', which follows. Therefore, 'None of the above' is the answer to the incomplete query of 'Her observations are recorded as.'

================================================================================
Question 802 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is the next step in your management plan for this patient?

Options:
✓ Urgent CT head
  Oral sumatriptan
  Short burst oxygen therapy
  Urgent lumber puncture
  Intravenous ceftriaxone

Explanation:
A sudden onset, severe, diffuse headache (often described as 'thunderclap' headache) with vomiting, especially in a previously healthy young woman, is a red flag for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The first and most crucial diagnostic step is an urgent non-contrast CT head to rule out SAH or other intracranial pathology. Oral sumatriptan is for migraine, oxygen for cluster headache, and LP/antibiotics are considered after CT (if SAH is ruled out and meningitis is suspected).

================================================================================
Question 803 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You're assessing a patient Glasgow coma scale at the bedside.What is the patients score based on these findings. when you arrive to the patient's bedside the patient eyes are closed,but they open when you speak to the patient,the patient does not respond appropriately to asked and says words that don't make sense .1n addition,the patient can't obey a motor command.Therefore , when you apply a central stimulus the patient moves to locate and remove the stimulus.

Options:
  GCS 12 (a V4M5)
  GCS 8 ( E2 V4M2)
✓ GCS 11 (E3 V3 M5)
  GCS 10 (a V3M4)
  None of the above

Explanation:
Let's break down the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) components: *   **Eye opening (E):** Eyes are closed but open when you speak to the patient (E3 - Opens eyes to verbal command). *   **Verbal response (V):** Patient does not respond appropriately and says words that don't make sense (V3 - Inappropriate words). *   **Motor response (M):** Patient can't obey a motor command, but moves to locate and remove a central stimulus (M5 - Localizes pain). So, the GCS score is E3 + V3 + M5 = 11. Option (c) is GCS 11 (E3 V3 M5).

================================================================================
Question 804 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 77 years old gentlemen with a history of HTN in the past which was well controlled developed gradual memory loss from the last 1 year. He is getting more forgetful and unable to remember where his car keys are. Few times he got lost on the way home from market. His neurological examination is unremarkable. He is having mini mental score of 19/30. His baseline investigation are all normal including thyroid function tests. His CT brain show age related brain atrophy. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Microvascular ischemia
  Levy body dementia
  Subdural Hematoma
✓ Alzheimer's disease
  None of the above

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of gradual, progressive memory loss (forgetting keys, getting lost), significant cognitive impairment (MMSE score 19/30), normal neurological exam (ruling out focal stroke), and normal labs (ruling out reversible causes like thyroid dysfunction) in an elderly individual with age-related brain atrophy on CT is highly consistent with Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly.

================================================================================
Question 805 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A4- years -old child is receiving treatment for septic meningitis and is now evaluated for complication like syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. The appropriate clue to the diagnosis is.

Options:
  Uncontrolled seizures
  Low serum calcium
✓ Serum sodium 126meq/ I
  Uncontrolled vomiting
  Depressed conscious level

Explanation:
The Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) is a common complication of meningitis. SIADH leads to excessive water retention, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia (low serum sodium). Therefore, a serum sodium level of 126 mEq/L (indicating hyponatremia) would be an appropriate clue to the diagnosis of SIADH in this context.

================================================================================
Question 806 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A college student is brought to the emergency department by friends holding him down. The physician is informed that student has taken some drug and then went crazy. The patient is agitated and delirious. On examination his skin is warm and sweaty and his pupils are dilated, bowel sounds are normal , Tachycardia, marked hypertension, hyperthermia, increased muscle tone and both horizontal and vertical nystagmus. The management of this patient is likely to include.

Options:
  Administration of epinephrine
  Alkalinization of urine
  Atropine to control hyperthermia
  Amitriptyline if psychosis ensues
✓ Ventilator support and control of seizure ( benzodiazepine) + haloperidol

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of agitation, delirium, warm/sweaty skin, dilated pupils, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, increased muscle tone, and nystagmus are highly suggestive of a sympathomimetic toxidrome (e.g., from cocaine, amphetamines) or a severe anticholinergic toxidrome, or potentially PCP intoxication (explaining nystagmus). In such severe drug-induced agitation and delirium, which can lead to hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis, immediate management focuses on supportive care, including ventilator support if respiratory compromise occurs, and controlling agitation/seizures. Benzodiazepines are typically first-line for agitation and seizures, and antipsychotics like haloperidol can be used for severe agitation or psychosis that doesn't respond to benzodiazepines. Therefore, option (e) encompasses crucial aspects of emergency management for this critical presentation.

================================================================================
Question 807 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35 year old man developed progressive lower limb weakness and gait ataxia over period of 6 months. Neurological examination demonstrated bilateral lower limb spasticity, increased deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs.Sensory examination showed no sensory level but loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation in both legs with preservation of temperature and pinprick sensations. These findings are suggestive of

Options:
  Brown-Séquard syndrome
  Syringomyelia
✓ Supacute combined degeneration of the cord
  Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery
  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Explanation:
The patient's clinical picture of progressive spasticity, increased deep tendon reflexes, Babinski signs (all upper motor neuron signs), and loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation (posterior column involvement) in the lower limbs, with preserved pain and temperature sensation, is classic for subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. This condition is typically caused by severe vitamin B12 deficiency, which primarily affects the dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord.

================================================================================
Question 808 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A study is conducted of patients who had increased phosphorylated tau and decreased Aß peptide in their CSF 5-10 years prior to death at ages ranging from 55 to 80 years. At autopsy their brain weights are less than normal for age and show hydrocephalus and cortical atrophy. Which of the following symptoms is most likely to be recorded in the medical histories of these patients?

Options:
  Choreiform movements
  Gait disturbances
  Grand mal seizures
✓ Progressive memory loss
  Symmetric muscular weakness

Explanation:
The CSF biomarkers (increased phosphorylated tau and decreased Aβ peptide), brain atrophy, and hydrocephalus ex vacuo are all hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. The most characteristic and prominent symptom associated with Alzheimer's disease is progressive memory loss, which precedes death by many years.

================================================================================
Question 809 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 30 year old woman presents with weekly headaches for the past 4 months. She has a feeling of pressure on both sides of her head. The pain is mild to moderate and lasts an hour. She is able to continue her activities but loses her appetite. She has some photophobia. The fundoscopic examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Cluster headache
  Migraine headache
✓ Tension-type headache
  Pseudotumor cerebri
  Paroxysmal hemicranias

Explanation:
The description of weekly headaches with a feeling of pressure on both sides of the head (bilateral), mild to moderate intensity, lasting an hour, and allowing her to continue activities, with some photophobia but no severe nausea/vomiting, is highly characteristic of a tension-type headache. Migraine headaches are typically unilateral, throbbing, and more severe, often with prominent nausea/vomiting and photophobia/phonophobia. Cluster headaches are unilateral, extremely severe, and associated with autonomic symptoms.

================================================================================
Question 810 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 63 years old woman undergoes total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Two days later she complains of a severe headache. Pain intensity is not related to posture. The least likely cause of this headache is:

Options:
  Caffeine withdrawal
  Viral illness
  Migraine
✓ Post Dural Puncture Headache
  Malingering

Explanation:
Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH) is a common complication of spinal anesthesia. A key characteristic of PDPH is that the headache is *postural*, meaning it worsens significantly in an upright position and improves or resolves when lying flat. The question states the pain intensity is *not related to posture*, making PDPH the *least likely* cause among the options, as all other options (caffeine withdrawal, viral illness, migraine, malingering) can cause headaches that are not necessarily postural.

================================================================================
Question 811 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient develops paralysis of the facial muscles on the left side. Neurological exam by her provider reveals that the forehead muscles are not involved. What would be the most appropriate investigation?

Options:
  Cerebral Angiography
✓ CT scan of head
  EEG
  EMG/NCV
  MRI Brain

Explanation:
Paralysis of the facial muscles on one side, with sparing of the forehead muscles, is indicative of an upper motor neuron (UMN) facial palsy. This typically occurs due to a lesion in the contralateral cerebral cortex or corticobulbar tract (e.g., stroke, tumor). A CT scan of the head would be the most appropriate initial investigation to rapidly identify such a central lesion, especially a stroke or hemorrhage, as the cause of a new-onset UMN facial palsy.

================================================================================
Question 812 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What is this describing: Transient loss of consciousness with abrupt onset and termination, unaccompanied by motor phenomenon except flickering of eyelids and minor alteration in motor tone.

Options:
✓ Absence seizures
  Atonic seizures
  Myoclonic seizures
  Tonic clonic seizures
  Tonic seizures

Explanation:
This description perfectly matches absence seizures. They are characterized by a transient (brief), abrupt loss of consciousness (often described as a blank stare), with abrupt onset and termination, typically lasting only a few seconds, and usually without prominent motor activity other than subtle automatisms (like eyelid flickering) or minor changes in muscle tone.

================================================================================
Question 813 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 80 year old female patient with atrial fibrillation came to ER with right sided weakness for the last 1 hour . Her past medical history includes transient ischemic attack, hypertension and diabetes. She was taking warfarin which she stopped after a fall one month back. Her examination show weakness in both upper and lower limbs an right side. A CT scan head showed no intracranial bleed . What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Bacterial meningitis
  Encephalitis
  Intracranial mass
✓ Ischaemic stroke
  Tuberculous meningitis

Explanation:
The sudden onset of right-sided weakness (hemiparesis/hemiplegia) in an elderly patient with atrial fibrillation (a strong risk factor for cardioembolic stroke) and who recently stopped warfarin (increasing stroke risk) is highly indicative of an ischemic stroke. A CT scan showing no intracranial bleed is consistent with an acute ischemic stroke (which may not be immediately visible on CT) rather than a hemorrhagic one.

================================================================================
Question 814 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 19 year old female student living in college hostel presented to ER with 1 day history of fever and headache. On physical examination her temperature was 39.1 degree Celsius and her heart rate was 124/mint . She was toxic. She had neck stiffness and there small , purple and non blanching petechiae on both her legs . Lumber puncture showed elevated opening pressure, elevated protein, pleocytosis and low glucose. What is the likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Fungal meningitis
✓ Meningococcal meningitis
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage
  Tuberculous meningitis
  Viral Encephalitis

Explanation:
The acute onset of high fever, headache, toxicity, neck stiffness, and the presence of a non-blanching petechial rash (small, purple lesions) are highly characteristic of meningococcal meningitis, caused by *Neisseria meningitidis*. The lumbar puncture findings (elevated pressure, protein, pleocytosis, and low glucose) further confirm bacterial meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 815 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45 year old man presented with recurrent transient ischemic attacks . He had progressive memory loss and right sided monoplegia (right upper limb). On examination, his blood pressure was 170/100 and pulse rate was 100/mint irregularly irregular. His temperature was 98F what is diagnosis?

Options:
  Alzheimer disease
  Encephalitis
✓ Multi infarct dementia
  Parkinsonism
  Prion disease

Explanation:
The patient's history of recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), progressive memory loss (dementia), focal neurological deficits (right-sided monoplegia), and uncontrolled hypertension with an irregularly irregular pulse (suggesting atrial fibrillation and embolic events) are all hallmark features of multi-infarct dementia (vascular dementia). This type of dementia is characterized by stepwise decline in cognitive function related to multiple small strokes.

================================================================================
Question 816 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 years old man presented to your clinic with increased talk, disinhibited behavior grandiose delusions, over-religiosity and inability to sleep for the last one month. He some time smoke cigarettes and cannabis also . He had similar episode a few years ago and got better with valproate sodium which he continues for several months. What is the most probable diagnosis in this case?

Options:
  Cannabis dependence
  Cannabis intoxication
  Epilepsy
✓ Manic episode
  Schizophrenia

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of increased talkativeness, disinhibited behavior, grandiose delusions, over-religiosity, and inability to sleep, lasting for one month, are classic features of a manic episode. The history of a similar episode in the past and response to valproate sodium (a mood stabilizer) strongly supports a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, currently in a manic episode. While cannabis use can exacerbate psychiatric symptoms, the pattern is indicative of a primary mood disorder.

================================================================================
Question 817 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A young patient of 30 years presented to neurosurgery OPD with complaints of pain lower back for the last one month. Which was associated with urinary and bowel incontinence. Patient was also having weakness in both lower limbs and was walking with support. On examination patient was having mixed upper motor neuron signs in both lower limbs and power in both Ll was 4/5 . Which level of Spinal cord might be involved?

Options:
  Cauda equine region
  cervical cord
✓ Conus area
  Dorsal Cord
  Lumber cord

Explanation:
The combination of lower back pain, bilateral lower limb weakness (mixed UMN signs suggest a lesion in the spinal cord, but the question asks about the *level*), and prominent urinary and bowel incontinence is highly suggestive of a lesion affecting the conus medullaris (the lowest part of the spinal cord). Cauda equina syndrome typically presents with lower motor neuron signs and more sensory loss in a saddle distribution. The conus area is known for causing early and severe bladder/bowel dysfunction along with leg weakness, often with mixed UMN/LMN features depending on the exact lesion.

================================================================================
Question 818 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 8 years old male child was brought to the OPD with 3 months history of gait problem with frequent falls . He was born to consanguineous parents by NVD at term with immediate cry. His development was normal. One of his 12 years old brother is bed ridden for the last 3 years. Who was previously normal. On examination, high stepping Gait, down going planters, diminished deep tendon reflexes, wasted distal limbs were found. His higher mental function and cerebellar examination are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Guillen Barre syndrome
✓ Hereditary sensory motor neuropathy
  Spinal cord tumor
  Spinal muscular atrophy
  Transverse myelitis

Explanation:
The progressive gait problem (high stepping gait suggests foot drop), frequent falls, diminished deep tendon reflexes, wasted distal limbs, and a positive family history (older brother bedridden with similar progression, suggesting an inherited condition) are highly indicative of a hereditary sensory motor neuropathy (HMSN), such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. These are chronic, progressive peripheral neuropathies. Normal cerebellar and mental functions rule out primary cerebellar or cerebral disorders. Guillain-Barré is acute, and SMA primarily affects proximal muscles.

================================================================================
Question 819 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher determined the correlation between sugar intake and body weight.What is the most appropriate statistical test used to establish the sugar intake as independent variable for predicting body weight as independent variable.

Options:
  ANOVA
  Chi square test
✓ Pearson Correlation
  t test
  z test

Explanation:
To determine the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables (sugar intake and body weight), Pearson correlation (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient) is the most appropriate statistical test.

================================================================================
Question 820 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
When the standard for accepting the difference was at p-value of 0.05 and the calculated value was 0.01, the null hypothesis was rejected by the researcher.What di you think of results?

Options:
  Alternate hypothesis is wrong
  Beta error is high
  No difference
✓ Significant difference
  Wrongly rejected

Explanation:
If the calculated p-value (0.01) is less than the predetermined alpha level (level of significance, 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected. This indicates that the observed difference or effect is statistically significant, meaning it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. Therefore, there is a significant difference.

================================================================================
Question 821 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The number of newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer per 100,000 women during a given year is expressed as?

Options:
✓ Incidence
  Prevalence
  Proportion
  Rate
  Ratio

Explanation:
Incidence refers to the occurrence of new cases of a disease in a population over a specified period. The phrase 'newly diagnosed cases...during a given year' directly indicates incidence. It can be expressed as an incidence rate or incidence proportion. However, 'incidence' is the best general descriptor here.

Question 822 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An epidemiologist calculates the relative risk to show the association of tobacco dip (Naswar) with sub mandibular gland carcinoma. What does this rate indicate?

Options:
✓ lt is the ratio of risk of disease fir those exposed and those not exposed to a particular risk factor
  Cannot be greater than 1
  Shows the percentage contribution that a risk factor makes towards the occurrence of disease
  Shows the relationship between a disease and a factor assumed to influence the occurrence of that disease
  Shows the relationship between two variables as the risk factor of disease

Explanation:
Relative risk (RR) is a measure of association used in cohort studies and randomized controlled trials. It is defined as the ratio of the risk of disease in the exposed group to the risk of disease in the unexposed group. An RR of 1 means no association, >1 means increased risk in the exposed, and <1 means decreased risk in the exposed.

================================================================================

Question:
Mental State examination (MSE) includes all of the following except:

Options:
  Appearance
  Thought
  Affect
  Cognition
✓ Diagnosis

Explanation:
The Mental State Examination (MSE) is a systematic assessment of an individual's current mental state, covering various domains such as appearance, behavior, speech, mood, affect, thought process, thought content, perception, cognition, and insight. 'Diagnosis' is the conclusion derived from the MSE and other clinical information, not a component of the MSE itself.

Question 826 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Female recently divorced presented with dizziness, retrosternal chest pain radiating to both arms and occasional difficulty in swallowing. What is the most likely diagnosis:

Options:
  Esophageal Spasm
✓ Panic attack
  Achalasia
  Angina pectoris
  Esophagitis

Explanation:
The symptoms of dizziness, retrosternal chest pain radiating to both arms, and difficulty swallowing, particularly in the context of a stressful life event (recent divorce), are highly suggestive of a panic attack. Panic attacks often mimic cardiac events or other serious medical conditions due to intense physical and psychological symptoms. While esophageal spasm can cause chest pain and dysphagia, the overall constellation, especially with dizziness and in a high-stress situation, strongly points to panic.

================================================================================
Question 827 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Delusional disorder is:

Options:
✓ Unrealistic fixed beliefs that cannot be changed
  Thought broadcasting
  Hearing of voices
  Crying spells
  Thought withdrawal

Explanation:
Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of one or more non-bizarre delusions that persist for at least one month. Delusions are 'unrealistic fixed beliefs that cannot be changed' by logic or evidence. Thought broadcasting, hearing voices, and thought withdrawal are typically features of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, not specifically delusional disorder.

================================================================================

Question:
Social anxiety disorder in most similar to which personality disorder:

Options:
  Schuizoid
  Dependent
  Antisocial
✓ Avoidant
  Narcissistic

Explanation:
Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) shares significant similarities with Avoidant Personality Disorder. Both conditions involve intense fear of social situations, fear of negative evaluation, feelings of inadequacy, and avoidance of social interactions. While social anxiety is a specific anxiety disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder is a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, the symptoms and underlying fears often overlap considerably.

================================================================================
Question 831 (NWSM - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The degree of awareness and Binderstanding of one's own illness called:

Options:
  Judgment

Options:
  Elusion of hopelessness
✓ Delusion of nihilism
  Delusion of prediction
  Delusion of poverty
  Delusion of infidelity

Explanation:
The statements 'The world is coming to an end,' 'my brain is dead,' and 'my organs are destroyed' are all classic examples of nihilistic delusions. These involve false beliefs that oneself, parts of oneself, or the world no longer exist or are in a state of decay and nothingness.

================================================================================
Question 833 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Two studies are conducted to assess the risk of developing asymptomatic liver mass in women taking oral contraceptive pills (OCP). Study A reports a relative risk of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.1-2.8) in women taking OCP compared to women not taking OCP over a five-year follow-up period. Study B reports a relative risk of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8-3.5) in women taking OCP compared to women not taking OCP over a five-year follow-up period. Which of the following statements about the two studies is most accurate?

Options:
  Study A overestimates the risk
  The result in study B proves no causality
  The result in study A is not accurate
✓ The sample size in study B is small
  The p value in study B is less than 0.05

Explanation:
Both studies show a similar relative risk (point estimate of 1.6 vs 1.5). However, Study A is statistically significant (CI does not cross 1.0), while Study B is not (CI crosses 1.0). The wider confidence interval in Study B suggests it had a smaller sample size (less power) to detect the difference.

He claimed that he had met the ex PM (who was in a disguise) while working as a mechanic, in his village in interior Punjab. He denies any hallucinations or any thought interference. What would be your likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute psychotic episode
  Bipolar affective disorder
✓ Delusional disorder
  Drug induced psychosis
  Paranoid schizophrenia

Explanation:
The patient presents with a complex, systematized delusion (conspiracy) but notably denies hallucinations or other thought disorders (like thought interference). The absence of prominent hallucinations or disorganized behavior favors Delusional Disorder over Schizophrenia.

================================================================================
Question 837 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 22 years old student has come to the OPD with the complaints of constant headaches. He described the headache around his forehead and head and temples.

Question 839 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 59-year-old person underwent surgery to repair an inguinal hernia. Lorazepam was administered as preanesthetic medication. General anesthesia was induced by propofol and maintained with halothane and nitrous oxide. Ondansetron was also given to prevent vomiting. Fifteen minutes after starting the operation, the electrocardiogram monitor showed ventricular tachycardia. Which of the drugs most likely caused this adverse effect?

Options:
  Lorazepam
  Propofol
  Nitrous oxide
✓ Halothane
  Ondansetron

Explanation:
Halothane sensitizes the myocardium to circulating catecholamines, significantly increasing the risk of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, especially in the presence of surgical stress.

Question 841 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 52 year Old Caucasian female presents to your office with a self-palpated thyroid nodule. After the appropriate workup, fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule is performed. The FNA result is negative. As you are explaining the test result, the patient asks, "What are the chances that I really do not have cancer?" You reply that the probability of thyroid cancer is low in her case because FNA has a high:

Options:
  Specificity
✓ Sensitivity
  Positive predictive value
  Negative predictive value
  Validity

Explanation:
To confidently rule out a disease with a negative test result, the test must have high Sensitivity (SnNout - Sensitivity Negative rules OUT). While the patient's specific question refers to the Negative Predictive Value, the doctor is explaining *why* the probability is low based on the test's intrinsic property: its high Sensitivity.

Strychnine poisoning causes antagonism of glycine receptors, leading to severe muscle spasms, opisthotonos, and "risus sardonicus" (sustained spasm of facial muscles looking like a grin).

================================================================================
Question 849 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 60-year-old man complains of difficulty walking. On examination, the patient appears stiff and stooped, shows an expressionless face, and speaks in a monotonous voice. A tremor of his fingers is apparent but ceases when he tries to reach for something. The substantia nigra of the patient differs from that of a normal brain. This pathologic finding is associated with which of the following biochemical changes?

Options:
  Increased b-amyloid biosynthesis
✓ reduced levels of dopamine
  Increased synthesis of GABA
  Increased release of NMDA
  Reduced tau protein self-assembly

Explanation:
The clinical description is characteristic of Parkinson's Disease (resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like face). This is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra.

================================================================================
Question 856 (NWSM - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32-year-old female complained to her physician that two breakthrough seizures occurred last week. One month earlier the woman was diagnosed with simple partial seizure and started treatment with an antiepileptic drug. The physician increased the dose of the drug, thinking that the decreased effect was most likely because the drug is a potent enzyme inducer and can induce its own metabolism. Which of the following drugs did the patient most likely take?

Options:
  Valproic acid
✓ Carbamazepine
  Lamotrigine
  Ethosuximide
  Clonazepam

Explanation:
Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic CYP450 enzymes. It also exhibits "auto-induction," where it induces the enzymes responsible for its own metabolism, often requiring dose adjustments after initiation.

  The 95% confidence interval for the RR includes 1.0
  The study has insufficient power to reach a definite conclusion
  There is a 10% probability that the association is underestimated

Explanation:
This question requires interpretation of RR and P. A p-value of 0.01 indicates statistical significance (chance of random finding is 1%). RR of 1.08 indicates an 8% increase in risk. While option A is phrased casually ('chance that... causes'), it is the intended interpretation of the Risk Ratio (1.08 = 8% excess risk) in the context of the exam options. (Strictly, p-value relates to the probability of the data given the null hypothesis, but option A describes the Risk Ratio magnitude).

What is most likely to affect the study results presented above?

Options:
  Recall bias
  Confounding
✓ Lead-time bias
  Selection bias
  Low sensitivity

Explanation:
Lead-time bias occurs when screening detects a disease earlier than it would have presented clinically. The patient 'survives' longer from the time of diagnosis simply because diagnosis happened earlier, not because they lived to an older age or the course of the disease changed.

Question 995 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 15-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room after suffering a tonic- clonic seizure 4 weeks after a bite by a rabid bat. The boy appears irritable and agitated, and his parents state that he has difficulty swallowing fluids. Lumbar puncture shows numerous lymphocytes. The patient becomes delirious, slips into a coma, and expires. At autopsy, the brain stem shows infilltrates of lymphocytes around small blood vessels and evidence of neuronophagia. Some neurons contain cosinophilic inclusions. What is the proper name for these neuronal inclusions?

Options:
  Councilman bodies
  Hirano bodies
  Lewy bodies
✓ Negri bodies
  Psammoma bodies

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a seizure following a rabid bat bite, along with dysphagia, agitation, and delirium, is characteristic of rabies. The pathognomonic histological finding in rabies is the presence of eosinophilic neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, known as Negri bodies, typically found in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, as well as brain stem neurons.

================================================================================
Question 997 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 88-year-old woman with Alzheimer disease dies of congestive heart failure. Examination of the brain at autopsy shows bilateral atrophy of the gyri, particularly in the frontal and hippocampal cortex. What additional finding might be expected in the brain of this patient?

Options:
  Cerebritis
✓ Hydrocephalus ex vacuo
  Lissencephaly
  Pachygyria
  Periventricular patches of demyelination

Explanation:
In Alzheimer's disease, significant cerebral atrophy, particularly in the frontal and hippocampal cortices, leads to an apparent enlargement of the ventricular system and subarachnoid space. This compensatory enlargement is known as hydrocephalus ex vacuo, where the cerebrospinal fluid fills the space previously occupied by atrophied brain tissue, without an actual increase in CSF pressure.

================================================================================
Question 998 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 35-year-old man with Down syndrome dies of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Gross examination of the patient's brain at autopsy shows mild microcephaly and underdevelopment of the superior temporal gyri. Histologic examination would most likely show which of the following neuropathologic changes?

Options:
  AA amyloidosis
  Lewy bodies
  Negri bodies
✓ Neurofibrillary tangles
  Spongiform encephalopathy

Explanation:
Individuals with Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) are predisposed to developing neuropathological changes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, often by middle age. The gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP) is located on chromosome 21, and its overexpression contributes to amyloid-beta accumulation.

================================================================================
Question 999 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 45-year-old woman is rushed to emergency room following an automobile accident. Ten hours after admission, the patient complains of a severe headache and blurred vision. An X-ray film of the cranium shows a fracture of the temporal parietal bone. Despite emergency craniotomy, the patient dies. Which of the following pathologic findings would be expected at autopsy?

Options:
✓ Epidural hematoma
  Intracerebral hemorrhage
  Intraventricular hemorrhage
  Subarachnoid hemorrhage
  Subdural hematoma

Explanation:
A fracture of the temporal parietal bone, especially involving the temporal bone, is a classic cause of epidural hematoma. The middle meningeal artery, which lies in a groove on the inner surface of the temporal bone, is often torn by such a fracture, leading to rapid arterial bleeding into the epidural space. This typically presents with a severe headache and can lead to rapid neurological deterioration.

================================================================================
Question 1000 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A previously healthy 31 years old female experiences a sudden severe headache and loses consciousness within an hour. CT scan reveals extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain. A lumbar puncture yields cerebrospinal fluid with many red blood cells, but no white blood cells. The CSF protein is slightly increased, but the glucose is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute bacterial meningitis
✓ Ruptured berry aneurysm
  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
  Hypertensive hemorrhage
  Amyloid arteriopathy

Explanation:
A sudden severe headache, often described as the 'worst headache of life,' followed by loss of consciousness and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on CT scan, is highly indicative of a ruptured berry aneurysm. The presence of numerous red blood cells in the CSF without a significant white blood cell response is consistent with a recent hemorrhage into the subarachnoid space.

================================================================================
Question 1001 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The best described etiology for Berry aneurysm is which of the following?

Options:
  Degeneration of internal elastic lamina
  Degeneration of tunica media
✓ Defect in muscular layer
  Low grade inflammation in the vessel wall
  Defect in tunica intima

Explanation:
Berry aneurysms, also known as saccular aneurysms, are thought to arise from congenital defects in the muscular layer (tunica media) of the arterial wall at points of bifurcation, particularly in the Circle of Willis. This weakness, combined with hemodynamic stress over time, leads to the formation and potential rupture of the aneurysm.

================================================================================
Question 1002 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:

  Intracerebral hemorrhage
  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage

Explanation:
Damage to the middle meningeal artery, often associated with a temporal bone fracture, is the classic cause of an epidural (extradural) hematoma. This bleeding occurs in the potential space between the dura mater and the inner surface of the skull.

================================================================================
Question 1004 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 12-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room in a coma after falling from an upper story window of his home. MRI shows a subdural hematoma over the left hemisphere. What is the most likely source of Intracranial bleeding in this patient?

Options:
✓ Bridging veins
  Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm
  Internal carotid artery
  Middle meningeal artery
  Sagittal sinus

Explanation:
Subdural hematomas typically result from the tearing of bridging veins that connect the surface of the cerebral cortex to the dural venous sinuses. These veins are stretched and torn when there is sudden or severe acceleration-deceleration forces on the brain, such as from a fall.

================================================================================
Question 1005 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The 28 yrsold male has a concussion injury while boxing. He persists in a vegetative coma for several months and then expires. A section of the temporal lobe shows massive proliferation of cells with a star- shaped appearance. Which of the following best accounts for this cellular response to injury?

Options:
  Axonal regeneration
  Chromatolysis
✓ Gliosis
  Leukodystrophy
  Neuronophagia

Explanation:
Gliosis is a non-specific reactive change of glial cells in response to damage to the central nervous system. It involves the proliferation and hypertrophy of astrocytes, which are star-shaped glial cells, forming a glial scar at the site of injury. This is a common response to various forms of brain injury, including trauma and prolonged coma.

================================================================================
Question 1006 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room with fever, vomiting, and convulsions. The patient is febrile to 39.50C (1040F), Physical examination reveals cervical rigidity and pajn in the neck and knees. Acute inflammation most likely involves which anatomic region of the patient's brain?

Options:
  Choroid plexus
  Ependyma
  Hypothalamus
  Lateral ventricles
✓ Leptomeninges

Explanation:
The symptoms of fever, vomiting, convulsions, and cervical rigidity (neck stiffness) are classic signs of meningitis, which is an inflammation of the meninges. Specifically, the acute inflammation primarily involves the leptomeninges, which consist of the arachnoid and pia mater, and the subarachnoid space where CSF circulates.

================================================================================
Question 1007 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 32-year-old woman presents with a 2-day history of headache, vomiting, and fever. Physical examination reveals cervical rigidity and knee pain with hip flexion. Lumbar puncture demonstrates an abundance of neutrophils and decreased levels of glucose. Which of the following diseases is most likely associated with these clinical laboratory findings?

Options:
✓ Meningococcal meningitis
  Neurosarcoidosis
  Staphylococcal meningitis
  Tuberculous meningitis
  Viral meningitis

Explanation:
The combination of headache, vomiting, fever, neck stiffness, and CSF findings of abundant neutrophils and decreased glucose is highly characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. Among the given options, meningococcal meningitis (caused by *Neisseria meningitidis*) and staphylococcal meningitis are types of bacterial meningitis. Given *Neisseria meningitidis* is a common cause, and often causes rapid progression, it is a strong fit.

================================================================================
Question 1008 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency room after suffering an epileptic seizure. Vital signs are normal. An X-ray of the patient's head shows a mass in the left cerebral hemisphere with scattered foci of calcification. Histologic examination of a brain biopsy rounded tumor cells with a clear halo around them (fried egg appearance). Which of the following is he appropriate diagnosis?

Options:
  Ependymoma
  Glioblastoma
  Hemangioblastoma
  Meningioma
✓ Oligodendroglioma

Explanation:
The histological findings of 'fried egg' appearance (round cells with clear halos) and often a 'chicken-wire' capillary pattern, along with the presence of calcification, are classic characteristics of an oligodendroglioma. These tumors commonly present with seizures and are often found in the cerebral hemispheres.

================================================================================
Question 1009 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which anatomic structure/region produces the CSF that accumulates in the brain of the neonate with hydrocephalus?

Options:
  Arachnoid
✓ Choroid plexus
  Corpus callosum
  Pia mater
  Subependymal areas of the cerebral hemispheres

Explanation:
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is primarily produced by the choroid plexus, which is located within the ventricles of the brain. An imbalance between CSF production and absorption can lead to hydrocephalus.

================================================================================
Question 1010 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 68-year-old man presents with a 2- week history of tonic-clonic seizures that initially involve his left arm but have more recently progressed to involve his left leg. The seizures are accompanied by muscle weakness but no other neurologic signs. A CT scan reveals a mass in the left cerebral hemisphere. A left frontoparietal craniotomy is performed. Histologic examination of the brain biopsy shows extensive necrosis and pallisading of tumor cells around necrosis. Which of the following is the appropriate diagnosis?

Options:
  Craniopharyngioma
  Ependymoma
  Ganglioglioma
✓ Glioblastoma multiforme
  Meningioma

Explanation:
The histological features of extensive necrosis and pseudopalisading of tumor cells around necrotic areas are pathognomonic for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive and common primary brain tumor in adults. The clinical presentation of new-onset seizures and a cerebral mass in an elderly patient is also consistent with GBM.

================================================================================
Question 1011 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
65 years old person was brought by his family. He was subconscious and inability to move his right upper limb, on inquiring he was suffering from Diabetes mellitus and hyper tension, he was taking some medicine for hypertension and diabetes mellitus, for the past two days he has skipped taking antihypertensive medication, on examination his BP was 210/130 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute and temperature was 99 FO what may be the clinical condition he was suffering.

Options:
  Meningitis
  Epilepsy
✓ Cerebrovascular accident
  Encephalitis
  Parkinsonism

Explanation:
The sudden onset of neurological deficits (subconsciousness, inability to move the right upper limb) in a patient with poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes is highly suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), either ischemic or hemorrhagic. The very high blood pressure (210/130 mmHg) further supports this, as hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke.

================================================================================
Question 1012 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
45 years old male patient presented with sudden onset of worsening paraplegia. He gives history of fever cough and since 3 months. On examination power is 3/5 in bilateral lower limbs. Tone is increased bilaterally, reflexes are brisk and plantars are bilateral upgoing.

Options:
  Motor neuron disease
  Guillian barre syndrome
  Myasthenia gravis
✓ Tuberculous spine
  Multiple sclerosis

Explanation:
The presentation of progressive paraplegia with upper motor neuron signs (increased tone, brisk reflexes, upgoing plantars) along with a long history of fever and cough for 3 months strongly suggests a chronic infectious process affecting the spinal cord. Tuberculous spine (Pott's disease) can lead to spinal cord compression and myelopathy with these neurological findings, consistent with a chronic systemic infection.

================================================================================
Question 1013 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Interneuclear ophthalmoplegia is a sign of

Options:
  Motor neuron disease
  Occulomotor nerve palsy
  Abducent nerve palsy
✓ Multiple sclerosis
  Transverse myelitis

Explanation:
Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is a disorder of conjugate horizontal gaze resulting from a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). It is a classic and highly characteristic sign of multiple sclerosis, although it can also be seen in other brainstem lesions such as stroke.

================================================================================
Question 1014 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
60 years old smoker a known hypertensive with poor control and non-compliant to his drugs presents sudden onset severe headache and vomiting. Describes as the worst headache of his life. Followed by unconsciousness. On examination the neck is stiff, BP 190/100 no focal neurological sign.

Options:
✓ Subarachnoid haemorrhage
  Meningococcal meningitis
  Viral encephalitis
  Tuberculous meningitis
  Potts disease

Explanation:
The sudden onset of the 'worst headache of life,' followed by unconsciousness and associated with a stiff neck, is the classic presentation of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Risk factors like smoking and poorly controlled hypertension further increase the likelihood of SAH, often due to a ruptured aneurysm.

================================================================================
Question 1015 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Following dysentery a 20 years old female presented with backache and progressive weakness of lower limbs over the past 5 days with recent weakness in upper limbs as well. The following will be expected.

Options:
  Deep breathing
✓ High levels of proteins with normal cells in the CSF
  High tone in the upper limbs
  High tone in the lower limbs
  Upgoing plantars

Explanation:
The clinical picture of ascending paralysis (weakness starting in lower limbs and progressing to upper limbs) following a gastrointestinal infection (dysentery) is characteristic of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). A classic CSF finding in GBS is albuminocytological dissociation, meaning high protein levels with a normal or low white blood cell count.

================================================================================
Question 1016 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An acute attack of multiple sclerosis is best treated with

Options:
  Beta interferon
  Methotrexate
✓ Intravenous methylprednisolone
  Physiotherapy
  NSAIDS

Explanation:
Acute exacerbations or 'attacks' of multiple sclerosis are typically treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, to reduce inflammation and shorten the duration of the relapse. While other treatments like beta interferons are disease-modifying therapies for long-term management, they are not used for acute attacks.

================================================================================
Question 1017 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The following is a true statement

Options:
  Fasciculations indicate an upper motor neuron illness
  Muscle wasting indicates an upper neuron illness
  There are no upper motor neurons in the spinal cord
✓ Upper motor neuron facial palsy spares the forehead
  Bells palsy is an upper motor neuron facial palsy

Explanation:
In an upper motor neuron facial palsy (e.g., from a stroke affecting the motor cortex), the forehead is typically spared because the upper part of the face receives bilateral innervation from both cerebral hemispheres, while the lower face receives contralateral innervation. Therefore, a lesion on one side of the brain will only paralyze the contralateral lower face, preserving forehead movement. Bell's palsy, on the other hand, is a lower motor neuron facial palsy affecting the entire side of the face.

================================================================================
Question 1018 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Glove and stocking pattern of sensory disturbance usually develops in the disease in

Options:
  Autonomic pathways
✓ Peripheral nerves
  Brainstem
  Spinal cord
  Thalamus

Explanation:
The 'glove and stocking' pattern of sensory loss, affecting the distal extremities symmetrically, is highly characteristic of polyneuropathy, a disease of the peripheral nerves. This pattern reflects the longest nerve fibers being affected first.

================================================================================
Question 1019 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
All are characteristic features of Parkinson's disease except

Options:
  Bradykinesia
  Rigidity
  Tremors
  Stooped posture
✓ Pendular knee jerk

Explanation:
Characteristic features of Parkinson's disease include bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity (often 'cogwheel' rigidity), resting tremor, and postural instability leading to a stooped posture. A pendular knee jerk (a prolonged, swinging movement of the leg after reflex tapping) is typically seen in cerebellar disease, not Parkinson's disease.

================================================================================
Question 1020 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The following is not a sign of meningeal Irritation

Options:
  Brudzinski's sign
✓ Grey turner sign
  Kernigs sign
  Neck stiffness
  Pain on flexion of neck

Explanation:
Brudzinski's sign, Kernig's sign, neck stiffness, and pain on flexion of the neck are all classic signs of meningeal irritation, typically found in meningitis. Grey Turner's sign, characterized by bruising of the flanks, is a sign of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, often associated with acute pancreatitis or other abdominal conditions, and is not related to meningeal irritation.

================================================================================
Question 1021 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
35 years old male presents with sudden onset of weakness of lower limbs started from the foot and ascending upwards. He also gives a history of diarrhea a few days ago. On examination power in the lower limbs is 2/5. ankle and knee jerk are absent. Plantars are mute. What is the diagnosis

Options:
  Multiple sclerosis
  Potts disease
  Myasthenia gravis
✓ Guillian barre syndrome
  Lewy body dementia

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of rapidly progressive ascending weakness, starting from the feet and moving upwards, coupled with areflexia (absent ankle and knee jerks), and a preceding history of diarrhea (suggesting an antecedent infection), is highly characteristic of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).

================================================================================
Question 1022 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
50 years old man presents with difficulty in walking, small handwriting and resting tremors. On examination he had mask like face, limbs were rigid. and rest of the neurological examination was 0k

Options:
  Spastic paraparesis
  Trasverse myelitis
  Alzheimers disease
✓ Paskinsons disease
  Crudzfeldt Jacobs disease

Explanation:
The combination of difficulty walking (gait disturbance), small handwriting (micrographia), resting tremors, mask-like facies (hypomimia), and limb rigidity are the cardinal signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

================================================================================
Question 1023 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An 18 year old hears voices discussing him in the third person he has:

Options:
  Temporal lobe epilepsy
  Depression
  Mania
✓ Schizophrenia
  Anxiety

Explanation:
Hearing voices discussing oneself in the third person is a classic example of a third-person auditory hallucination, which is a common and highly characteristic symptom of schizophrenia.

================================================================================
Question 1024 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The most appropriate statement regarding spinal tumors is

Options:
  Extradural spinal tumors have the least incidence among =11.
  Astrocytotoms are intramedullary tumors
✓ Among Extradural tumors metastasis is the commonest tumors.
  Back pain secondary to spinal tumors does not occur on lying lying positions.
  Meningiomas have the least vascularity

Explanation:
Among extradural spinal tumors, metastatic tumors are by far the most common, accounting for a significant majority of cases. Primary spinal cord tumors are much less common than metastatic ones.

================================================================================
Question 1025 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Following statement is not correct regarding Aneurysmal SAH,

Options:
  Surgical clipping or coiling is the end treatment.
  Delayed cerebral ischemia is the main cause of death.
  The risk of rebleeding is greatest in. first 07days.
✓ SAH in these patients does not cause hydrocephalus.
  Prophylactic anticonvulsants have no role in SAH.

Explanation:
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), especially from a ruptured aneurysm, can frequently cause acute or chronic hydrocephalus. Blood in the subarachnoid space can impair CSF reabsorption by the arachnoid granulations or obstruct CSF flow, leading to ventricular dilation and increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the statement that SAH does not cause hydrocephalus is incorrect.

================================================================================
Question 1026 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Etiology of acute ataxia is

Options:
  Wilson disease
  Ataxic cerebral palsy
✓ Guillain Barre Syndrome
  Ataxia telangiectasia
  Leukodystrophy

Explanation:
While many conditions can cause ataxia, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) can present with acute ataxia as a primary symptom or in combination with weakness, especially in its Miller Fisher variant (ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia). Many of the other options are causes of chronic or developmental ataxia.

================================================================================
Question 1027 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one is not the sign of pyogenic meningitis?

Options:
  Fever
✓ Diarrhea
  Headache
  Vomiting
  Neck stiffness

Explanation:
Common symptoms of pyogenic (bacterial) meningitis include fever, headache, vomiting, and neck stiffness. While some systemic infections that *lead* to meningitis might cause diarrhea, diarrhea itself is not considered a direct sign of meningeal irritation or a characteristic symptom of meningitis itself.

================================================================================
Question 1028 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The best investigation for the diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis is

Options:
  Complete blood count
  CT SCAN brain
  X-ray chest
✓ Complete examination of cerebrospinal fluid
  Blood culture

Explanation:
A complete examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained via lumbar puncture is the gold standard for diagnosing pyogenic meningitis. This includes cell count and differential, protein and glucose levels, Gram stain, and culture, which provide definitive information about the presence and type of infection.

================================================================================
Question 1029 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The common bacteria which causes meningitis

Options:
  Pneumococcus
  Haemophalus influenza
  Nesserria meningitis is
  Staphylococcus
✓ All of the above

Explanation:
*Streptococcus pneumoniae* (Pneumococcus), *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib), and *Neisseria meningitidis* (Meningococcus) are among the most common bacterial causes of meningitis, with their prevalence varying by age group and vaccination status. *Staphylococcus* species can also cause meningitis, particularly in post-surgical or immunocompromised patients. Therefore, all listed bacteria are common causes of meningitis.

================================================================================
Question 1030 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Pathognomic sign for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is

Options:
  Neck stiffness
  Severe headache
  Coma
✓ Tubercles on ophthalmoscope
  Fits

Explanation:
While neck stiffness, headache, coma, and seizures (fits) can be seen in tuberculous meningitis (TBM), the presence of choroidal tubercles (tubercles on the ophthalmoscope in the retina/choroid) is a highly specific, though not always present, pathognomonic sign for the diagnosis of TBM, indicating disseminated tuberculosis.

================================================================================
Question 1031 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Immediately after the surgery, the patient is usually shifted to

Options:
  CCU
✓ PACU
  ICU
  HDU
  Recovery Room

Explanation:
Immediately after surgery, patients are typically transferred to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), also known as the recovery room. In the PACU, patients are closely monitored as they recover from anesthesia and the immediate effects of surgery before being moved to a general ward, ICU, or discharged.

================================================================================
Question 1032 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Benzodiazepine are thought to cause sedative and anxiolytic effects by:

Options:
  Acting as a partial agonist at SHT receptors
  Blocking the NMDA glutamate receptor subtypes
  Enhancing the action of dopamine receptors
✓ Facilitating GABA mediated increase in chloride conductance
  Increasing functional activity at GABA, receptors

Explanation:
Benzodiazepines exert their sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects primarily by binding to a specific site on the GABA-A receptor complex. This binding enhances the inhibitory effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.

================================================================================
Question 1033 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with decreased cardiopulmonary reserve goes into cardiac arrest due to hypoxia experienced minutes after a surgery. Which one of the following anesthetics was he most likely administered?

Options:
  Desflurane
  Enflurane
✓ Halothane
  Isoflurane
  Nitrous Oxide

Explanation:
Halothane is known to be a potent myocardial depressant and can cause significant bradycardia and arrhythmias, increasing the risk of cardiac arrest, especially in patients with compromised cardiovascular function. While other volatile anesthetics can also have cardiovascular effects, halothane is particularly noted for its myocardial depressant properties.

================================================================================
Question 1034 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient is given an intravenous general anesthetic. However it causes increased heart rate and increase in blood pressure during the surgery. Which one of the following drugs is responsible for this complication?

Options:
  Etomidate
✓ Ketamine
  Midazolam
  Propofol
  Thiopentone

Explanation:
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that often causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure due to its indirect sympathomimetic effects (e.g., stimulating catecholamine release). This distinguishes it from other intravenous anesthetics like propofol and thiopental, which typically cause cardiovascular depression.

================================================================================
Question 1035 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 48 years old patient has episodes of sudden repeated bursts of excruciating pain lasting a few seconds involving the upper part of the left side of his face. Which of the following drugs is a drug of choice for the above condition?

Options:
  Acetyl salicylic acid
✓ Carbamazepine
  Imipramine
  Phenytoin
  Valproic acid

Explanation:
The description of sudden, repeated bursts of excruciating, short-lasting pain in the face is classic for trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine is considered the drug of choice and first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia.

================================================================================
Question 1036 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
EMLA (Eutetic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) is a mixture of Lignocaine and which of the following local anesthetics that penetrates the keratinised layer of the skin and is used. in pediatric patients?

Options:
  Benzocaine
  Bupivacaine
  Chloroprocaine
✓ Prilocaine
  Ropivacaine

Explanation:
EMLA cream is a eutectic mixture of local anesthetics, specifically containing lidocaine (lignocaine) and prilocaine. This mixture allows for a lower melting point and thus better skin penetration, making it effective for topical anesthesia, particularly in pediatric patients before venipuncture or other superficial procedures.

================================================================================
Question 1037 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A chronic alcoholic is brought to the emergency with signs and symptoms of ataxia, confusion, nystagmus and paralysis of extraocular muscles. Considering his symptoms which bne of the following drugs should be administered immediately besides a sedative hypnotic drug?

Options:
  Flumazenil.
  Folic Acid
  Naloxone
  Pyridoxine
✓ Thiamine

Explanation:
The symptoms of ataxia, confusion (encephalopathy), nystagmus, and ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of extraocular muscles) in a chronic alcoholic are classic for Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is caused by acute thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. Immediate administration of thiamine is crucial to prevent progression to irreversible Korsakoff's syndrome and to treat the acute symptoms.

================================================================================
Question 1038 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 21 years old boy taking some drug of abuse is having hyperphagia, seerns happy and laughs a lot. His eyes are often red and he mostly suffers from tachycardia. He has indifferent approach to the ongoing events in his life. Which of the following drugs he is most likely taking?

Options:
✓ Cannabis
  Cocaine
  Ethanol
  LSD
  Nicotine

Explanation:
The constellation of symptoms including hyperphagia (increased appetite, 'munchies'), euphoria ('happy and laughs a lot'), red eyes (conjunctival injection), tachycardia, and an indifferent or relaxed approach to events are characteristic effects of cannabis (marijuana) use.

================================================================================
Question 1039 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient with Parkinsonism on medication is having off periods of akinesia. Which one of the following drugs given as a subcutaneous injection will most likely provide temporary relief of these off periods in this patient?

Options:
  Amantadine
✓ Apomorphine
  Bromocriptine
  Selegiline
  Tolcapone

Explanation:
Apomorphine is a potent dopamine agonist that can be administered as a subcutaneous injection to provide rapid, temporary relief ('rescue') for acute 'off' periods (episodes of severe akinesia or motor fluctuations) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who are experiencing insufficient response to oral medications.

================================================================================
Question 1040 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 53 years old patient with glaucoma, BPH and cardiovascular disease is suffering from major depression. Which one of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?

Options:
✓ Amitriptyline
  Ergotamine
  Propranolol
  Sumatriptan
  Valproic Acid

Explanation:
Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) known for its significant anticholinergic side effects. These effects (like urinary retention, blurred vision, increased intraocular pressure, and cardiac arrhythmias) would be particularly problematic and potentially dangerous in a patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), glaucoma, and cardiovascular disease.

================================================================================
Question 1041 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following MAO inhibitors is a reversible, selective MAO A Inhibitor and is least likely to need dietary restrictions with its use?

Options:
  Isocarboxazid
✓ Moclobemide
  Phenelzine
  Selegiline
  Tranylcypromine

Explanation:
Moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA). Unlike non-selective and irreversible MAOIs (like isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine), RIMAs are less likely to cause a 'cheese reaction' (hypertensive crisis due to tyramine ingestion) and therefore often require fewer or less stringent dietary restrictions.

================================================================================
Question 1042 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following neurolept has been shown to be a partial agonist at the D2 receptors?

Options:
✓ Aripiprazole
  Clozapine
  Haloperidol
  Risperidone
  Thioridazine

Explanation:
Aripiprazole is a unique atypical antipsychotic that acts as a partial agonist at D2 (dopamine) and 5-HT1A (serotonin) receptors, and an antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors. This partial agonism is thought to contribute to its different side effect profile and efficacy compared to full D2 antagonists.

================================================================================
Question 1043 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following actions of chlorpromazine is not based on its antidopaminergic property?

Options:
  Antipsychotic
  Antiemetic
  Dystonias
  Hyperprolactemic
✓ Hypotensive

Explanation:
Chlorpromazine's antipsychotic effect, antiemetic effect, propensity to cause dystonias (extrapyramidal symptoms), and hyperprolactinemia are all mediated by its blockade of dopamine D2 receptors. Its hypotensive effect, however, is primarily due to its alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocking activity, leading to vasodilation.

================================================================================
Question 1044 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following is a major limitation in the use of Clozaping for the treatment of schizophrenia?

Options:
  High incidence of extra pyramidal side effects
  Incidence of postural hypotension
  Its inability to benefit negative symptoms of schizophrenia
✓ Its potential to cause agranulocytosis
  Production of hyperprolactenemia

Explanation:
Agranulocytosis, a severe and potentially fatal reduction in white blood cells, is a rare but serious side effect of clozapine. This risk necessitates regular blood monitoring and is a major limitation to its widespread use, despite its superior efficacy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

================================================================================
Question 1045 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A 27 years old man comes to the OPD with complaints of numbness and tingling in his fingers and tops. The patient had been taking a drug for one month to abort migraine headaches. Which one of the following drugs most likely caused the symptoms in this patient?

Options:
✓ Amitriptyline.
  Fluoxetine
  Mirtazepine
  Trazodone
  Venlafaxine

Explanation:
Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), is often used for migraine prophylaxis. Paresthesias (numbness and tingling) are a recognized, though less common, side effect of TCAs. While other antidepressants can also cause paresthesias, given its use in migraine prophylaxis, amitriptyline is the most plausible answer among the choices.

================================================================================
Question 1046 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following adverse effects is most likely to be produced in a patient on prolonged lithium therapy?

Options:
  Diabetes mellitus
✓ Goiter
  Gout
  Parkinsonism
  Tardive Dyskinesia

Explanation:
Prolonged lithium therapy is well-known to cause thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroidism and goiter. Regular monitoring of thyroid function is therefore essential in patients receiving lithium.

================================================================================

Question 1048 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Carbidopa is added to the treatment regimen in a person already taking Levodopa for parkinson's disease. Which of the following effects will least likely be minimized by the addition of Carbidopa?

Options:
  Arrythmias
  Interaction with Pyridoxine
✓ Involuntary movements
  Nausea and vomiting
  Postural Hypotension

Explanation:
Carbidopa inhibits peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa, increasing its availability to the brain and thereby reducing peripheral side effects like nausea, vomiting, and cardiac arrhythmias, and minimizing interaction with pyridoxine. However, it does not significantly reduce the central nervous system side effects of levodopa, such as involuntary movements (dyskinesias), which are primarily due to increased dopamine in the brain.

================================================================================
Question 1049 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following molecular actions most likely mediates the analgesic effect of morphine?

Options:
  Closing of Clion channels on postsynaptic neurons
  Closing of Na ion channels on presynaptic nerve terminals
  Opening of Ca channels on presynaptic nerve terminals
✓ Opening of K channels on postsynaptic neurons
  Stimulation of substance P release from nociceptive nerve terminals

Explanation:
Morphine, an opioid agonist, produces analgesia primarily by acting on mu-opioid receptors. This action leads to several cellular effects, including the opening of potassium channels on postsynaptic neurons (leading to hyperpolarization and decreased excitability) and the closing of voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic nerve terminals (reducing neurotransmitter release, including substance P).

================================================================================
Question 1050 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A patient known to be a heroin abuser is brought to emergency after suffering from a severe roadside accident. The house officer administers nalbuphine to him for the pain, Why administration of nalbuphine to this patient not considered a good choice?

Options:
  Nalbuphine is a strong u receptor agonist
  Nalbuphine is a weaker analgesic than morphine
✓ Nalbuphine may precipitate a withdrawal state
  'The patient is probably cross tolerant to nalbuphine
  Vasodilating effects of nalbuphine may increase blood loss

Explanation:
Nalbuphine is an opioid agonist-antagonist, meaning it acts as an agonist at kappa-opioid receptors but an antagonist at mu-opioid receptors. In a patient physically dependent on a mu-opioid agonist like heroin, administering nalbuphine can displace the heroin from the mu-receptors and precipitate an acute and severe opioid withdrawal syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 1051 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which one of the following intravenous anesthetic agents possesses anti emetic properties?

Options:
  Diazepam
✓ Propofol
  Ketamine
  Midazolam
  Bupivacaine

Explanation:
Propofol is an intravenous general anesthetic that is well-known for its antiemetic properties, making it a favorable choice in patients prone to postoperative nausea and vomiting.

================================================================================
Question 1052 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following drugs causes dissociative anesthesia

Options:
  Diazepam
  Etomidate
✓ Ketamine
  Propofol
  Thiopentone sodium

Explanation:
Ketamine is unique among general anesthetics in that it produces a state of 'dissociative anesthesia,' characterized by profound analgesia, amnesia, and a cataleptic state, where the patient appears awake but unresponsive to their surroundings. It acts primarily by blocking NMDA receptors.

================================================================================
Question 1053 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
What mixture of gases is used in anesthesia?

Options:
  02 and C02
  02 , C02, N20
✓ 02 and N20
  C02 and N20
  Room Air and N20

Explanation:
Inhalation anesthesia commonly involves the administration of a volatile anesthetic agent (like halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane) along with a carrier gas mixture, typically oxygen (O2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Nitrous oxide provides additional analgesia and reduces the amount of volatile agent needed.

================================================================================
Question 1054 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Fatal period of ethanol poisoning is:

Options:
  12-24 hours
  few minutes
  24-48 hours
✓ 3-4 hours
  Few seconds

Explanation:
The fatal period for severe ethanol poisoning can vary greatly depending on the dose, individual tolerance, and other factors, but typically, significant central nervous system depression leading to respiratory arrest or other complications can occur within a few hours (3-4 hours) after ingesting a fatal dose.

================================================================================
Question 1055 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Cause of death in Inebriant poisoning is:

Options:
  Failure of renal system
✓ Failure of respiratory system
  Failure of cardiovascular system
  Failure of endocrine system
  Failure of digestive system

Explanation:
Inebriant poisons, such as alcohol or sedatives, primarily cause death through severe central nervous system depression, leading to respiratory arrest (failure of the respiratory system) due to suppression of the brainstem's respiratory centers.

================================================================================
Question 1056 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Cause of death in café coronary:

Options:
✓ asphyxia
  Laryngeal edema
  Cardiac arrest
  Hypertension
  Alcoholic gastritis

Explanation:
A "café coronary" is a term used to describe a sudden death caused by choking on food, usually a large bolus of poorly chewed meat, leading to aspiration and acute airway obstruction. The primary cause of death is asphyxia. It mimics a heart attack (coronary) but is due to an obstructed airway.

================================================================================
Question 1057 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Poisonous part of Dhatura plant is:

Options:
  Roots
  Stems
  Leaves
✓ Seeds
  Flowers

Explanation:
All parts of the Datura plant contain toxic tropane alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine, hyoscyamine), but the seeds are particularly concentrated and are often involved in poisonings due to their appearance and ease of ingestion.

================================================================================
Question 1058 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The following poison is used as a stupefying agent:

Options:
  Paraquat
  Physostigmine
  Kerosene
  Methanol
✓ Vedhatura

Explanation:
'Vedhatura' is likely a colloquial or misspelled term referring to Datura (also known as Dhatura, thorn apple), whose alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine) have strong anticholinergic effects that can cause confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, and sedation, effectively making it a 'stupefying agent.'

================================================================================
Question 1059 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Most potent form of cannabis indica is:

Options:
  Bhang
✓ Charas
  Majun
  Ganja
  Heroin

Explanation:
Among the forms of Cannabis indica listed, Charas (hashish) is typically the most potent. It is a concentrated resin collected from the cannabis plant, containing a higher concentration of psychoactive cannabinoids like THC compared to dried leaves (bhang) or flowering tops (ganja). Heroin is an opioid, not a form of cannabis.

================================================================================
Question 1060 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A person brought by the police from a railway platform. He is havingdry mouth, hot skin, facial flushing, staggering gait and a slurred speech. The most probable diagnosis is:

Options:
  Alcohol intoxication
  Organophosphorous poisoning
✓ Dhatura poisoning
  Cabon monoxide poisoning
  Carbamates poisoning

Explanation:
The symptoms of dry mouth, hot skin, facial flushing, staggering gait, and slurred speech are classic signs of anticholinergic toxicity, often summarized as 'hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, mad as a hatter.' Datura poisoning, due to its tropane alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine), causes anticholinergic syndrome.

================================================================================
Question 1061 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
nux vomica seeds are:

Options:
  Hard, flat and ash grey
  Soft, flat and ash grey
  Hard, spherical and red
✓ Hard, flat and convex on both sides
  Hard and round with concave sides

Explanation:
Nux vomica seeds (from *Strychnos nux-vomica*) are typically hard, flat, disc-shaped, and usually have a slightly convex shape on both sides, often with a grayish or silvery-gray, velvety surface.

================================================================================
Question 1062 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In strychnine poisoning the body is arched back in position and thepatient is seemed to be standing on their heels.This condition is called:

Options:
  Pleurosthotonas
✓ Opisthotonus
  Emprosthotonus
  Risussardonicus
  AcEwan's sign

Explanation:
Opisthotonus is a severe arching of the back with head thrown backward, often seen in strychnine poisoning or tetanus, due to intense spasms of extensor muscles. The patient appears to be standing on their head and heels.

================================================================================
Question 1063 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Fatal dose of strychnine poisoning is:

Options:
  1 crushed seed
  6 crushed seeds
  2 whole seeds
✓ 1 whole seed
  2 crushed seeds

Explanation:
The fatal dose of strychnine can be as low as 30-120 mg in adults, and even a single whole nux vomica seed (containing 20-30 mg of strychnine) can be fatal, especially if crushed, leading to rapid absorption and severe toxicity.

================================================================================
Question 1064 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In postmortem appearance of strychnine poisoning rigor mortis:

Options:
✓ Develops rapidly and lasts for a short period
  Develops slowly
  Does not develop at all
  Lasts for a shorter period
  Develops rapidly

Explanation:
In strychnine poisoning, the intense muscular spasms before death deplete ATP stores rapidly. This leads to a rapid onset of rigor mortis postmortem, but because the ATP is so quickly used up, the rigor mortis also tends to be short-lived compared to normal.

================================================================================
Question 1065 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Following is used in the treatment of narcolepsy:

Options:
  Cocaine
✓ Amphetamine
  Cannabis indica
  Kerosene
  Brucine

Explanation:
Amphetamines and other CNS stimulants (like methylphenidate or modafinil) are used in the treatment of narcolepsy to combat excessive daytime sleepiness and improve wakefulness.

================================================================================
Question 1066 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Large dose effect of amphetamines include:

Options:
  Nausea
  Insomnia
✓ Delirium with auditory hallucinations
  Cuphoria
  Abdominal cramps

Explanation:
While amphetamines at therapeutic doses can cause euphoria and insomnia, large doses can lead to severe CNS overstimulation, resulting in delirium, psychosis (often with paranoid delusions and auditory/visual hallucinations), severe agitation, and hyperthermia.

================================================================================
Question 1067 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Trip' is the psychotrophic effect resulting from the use of:

Options:
  Stimulants
  Spinal poisons
  Inebriants
✓ Hallucinogens
  Deliriants

Explanation:
A 'trip' is a common term used to describe the altered state of consciousness, including hallucinations, altered perceptions, and emotional shifts, experienced after ingesting psychedelic or hallucinogenic drugs like LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline.

================================================================================
Question 1068 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The following is synthesized from 'rya ergot':

Options:
  Phencyclidine
  Benzedrin
  Peyote
  Mescaline
✓ LSD(Lysergic Acid diethylamide)

Explanation:
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent psychedelic drug that is chemically derived from lysergic acid, a compound found in ergot alkaloids, which are produced by the fungus *Claviceps purpurea* (rye ergot).

================================================================================
Question 1069 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Following is given orally to slow down the absorption of kerosene:

Options:
✓ 250ml liquid paraffin
  Stearic acid
  450 ml liquid paraffin
  Mineral oil
  Activated charcoal

Explanation:
While managing kerosene poisoning primarily involves supportive care and preventing aspiration, some historical or regional practices might involve the administration of a liquid paraffin (mineral oil) orally. Liquid paraffin can act as a laxative and a demulcent, potentially binding to some unabsorbed kerosene and hastening its passage through the gut, thereby theoretically slowing down absorption or reducing contact time, though its efficacy and safety are debated and not universally recommended over other measures like activated charcoal (which is generally ineffective for hydrocarbons) or direct treatment of complications. Given the options, and the context of "oral to slow down absorption," liquid paraffin is the intended answer despite modern guidelines often prioritizing other measures.

================================================================================
Question 1070 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Fatal dose of kerosene is:

Options:
  1-2ml
✓ more than 10ml
  0.1ml
  5ml
  7-8ml

Explanation:
The fatal dose of kerosene is highly variable and depends on factors like age, route of exposure, and individual sensitivity. While aspiration of even a small amount (e.g., 1-2 ml) can cause severe pneumonitis, the lethal oral dose is generally considered to be above 10-30 mL in adults, though severe toxicity can occur at lower doses in children. Given the options, 'more than 10ml' is the most plausible for a fatal oral dose.

================================================================================
Question 1071 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
It is not a sign of organophosphorous poisoning:

Options:
  Miosis
✓ Bronchodilation
  Bradycardia
  Salivation
  Tremors

Explanation:
Organophosphorus poisoning inhibits acetylcholinesterase, leading to excessive cholinergic stimulation. This results in symptoms like miosis (pupil constriction), bradycardia, salivation, bronchorrhea, bronchoconstriction (not bronchodilation), muscle fasciculations, and tremors. Therefore, bronchodilation is not a sign; bronchoconstriction is.

================================================================================
Question 1072 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
The delusion having serious medico-legal implications is:

Options:
  Delusion of grandeur
  Delusion of infidelity
  Nihilistic delusion
✓ Delusional jealousy
  Delusion of persecution

Explanation:
Delusional jealousy (also known as Othello syndrome) is a specific type of delusion where an individual falsely believes their partner is being unfaithful. This delusion can have serious medico-legal implications as it frequently leads to stalking, harassment, and violence towards the perceived unfaithful partner or imagined lovers. Delusions of persecution can also lead to violence against perceived tormentors.

================================================================================
Question 1073 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Anesthetics are:

Options:
  Somniferous poisons
  Deliriant poisons
✓ Inebriant poisons
  Spinal poisons
  Peripheral poisons

Explanation:
Anesthetics are substances that induce a reversible state of central nervous system depression, leading to loss of consciousness, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. In toxicology, compounds that cause intoxication and CNS depression are classified as inebriant poisons.

================================================================================
Question 1074 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Following conditions are correctly matched with causing agent except:

Options:
  Delirium tremens- alcohol
  Meets line arsenic
  Muttering delirium-dhatura
  Risus sardonicus —strychnine
✓ Run amok morphine

Explanation:
Delirium tremens is an acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Mees lines (typo 'Meets line') are white transverse lines on fingernails associated with arsenic poisoning. Muttering delirium is a symptom of anticholinergic poisoning (e.g., Dhatura). Risus sardonicus (a sustained, sardonic grin due to muscle spasms) is characteristic of strychnine poisoning. 'Run amok' is a cultural syndrome involving a sudden, frenzied, violent rampage, typically associated with psychotic states or disinhibition, not directly with morphine, which is a central nervous system depressant.

================================================================================
Question 1075 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A person after ingesting a toxic agent is in a state of Narcosis. The pupils are contracted. However, on pinching the neck the pupils dilate initially and slowly return to their original size. The toxic agent is:

Options:
  Alcohol
  Barbiturate
  Carbolic acid
✓ Organophosphate
  Strychnine

Explanation:
Narcosis (stupor/coma) and contracted pupils (miosis) are characteristic of both opioid and organophosphate poisoning. In organophosphate poisoning, due to excessive cholinergic stimulation, pupils are intensely miotic, but can still exhibit a transient, sluggish dilation in response to strong painful stimuli (like pinching the neck) due to sympathetic response, before returning to their constricted state.

================================================================================
Question 1076 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Ordinary fatal dose of cocaine is:

Options:
✓ 1 gm
  2 gm
  3 gm
  Heroin
  5 gm

Explanation:
The fatal dose of cocaine can vary significantly based on route of administration, individual tolerance, and purity. However, for oral ingestion, doses as low as 1 gram are often cited as potentially fatal in non-tolerant adults.

================================================================================
Question 1077 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Which of the following poisons is considered to be a stupefying poison?

Options:
  Cocaine
✓ Dhatura
  Heroin
  Opium
  Strychnine

Explanation:
Stupefying poisons are substances that cause mental confusion, disorientation, and dazedness, making a person vulnerable. Dhatura (thorn apple) contains anticholinergic alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine) that induce a state of delirium, hallucinations, and impaired consciousness, fitting the description of a stupefying agent often used in criminal contexts. Opium also causes narcosis, a stupefying effect.

================================================================================
Question 1078 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Kleptomania refers to:

Options:
  Evading problems
  Maiming animals
  Manic-depressive psychoses
  Setting fire to things
✓ Stealing minor things

Explanation:
Kleptomania is an impulse control disorder characterized by a recurrent, irresistible urge to steal items that are not needed for personal use or monetary value. The act of stealing itself, rather than the stolen object, is the primary source of gratification.

================================================================================
Question 1079 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
You see a 19 year old female student in your clinic who displays odd behaviors, deemed culturally and socially inappropriate. These include inappropriate behavior such as oversharing intimate information and describing close physical familiarity with strangers, noted by her and the family also.What would be your most likely diagnosis?

Options:
  Acute stress disorder
  Adjustment disorder
✓ Dis-inhibited social engagement disorder
  Post-Traumatic Stress disorder/PTSD
  Reactive attachment disorder

Explanation:
Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) is an attachment disorder typically stemming from severe neglect in childhood. It is characterized by overly familiar and inappropriate social behavior with strangers, such as oversharing personal information, showing little reticence in approaching unfamiliar adults, and exhibiting culturally inappropriate verbal or physical behavior.

================================================================================
Question 1080 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A medical officer while examining a person with history of alcohol intoxication pinch on his neck, the pupils get constricted which were dilated initially and slowly return to their original size. This is known as:

Options:
  Freezed sign
  McEwan's sign
  Ophthalmic sign
✓ Ploquetls sign
  Robert's sign

Explanation:
Ploquet's sign refers to the pupillary response to a painful stimulus (like pinching the neck) in a state of central nervous system depression, often due to alcohol intoxication. The pupils, which might be dilated, show a transient constriction followed by a slow return to their previous size, indicating some remaining sympathetic reflex activity.

================================================================================
Question 1081 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Coke, crack, crystal and freebase are different names used for:

Options:
  Alcohol
  Cannabis
✓ Cocaine
  Heroin
  Morphine

Explanation:
These are common street terms associated with cocaine. 'Coke' is powdered cocaine, 'crack' is a freebase form of cocaine that is smoked, and 'crystal' and 'freebase' refer to methods of preparing cocaine for smoking, yielding a rapid and intense high.

================================================================================
Question 1082 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Hallucinations, disorientation and confabulation, which is loss of memory for the recent events and filling the gaps with fabricated ones are features of:

Options:
  Acute hallucinosis
  Alcoholic hallucinosis
  Delirium tremens
✓ Korsakoffs psychosis
  Toxic psychosis

Explanation:
Korsakoff's psychosis (or syndrome) is a chronic memory disorder caused by severe thiamine deficiency, often associated with chronic alcoholism. Its hallmark features include profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia, disorientation, and prominent confabulation (fabricating false memories to fill in gaps in recall), often accompanied by hallucinations.

================================================================================
Question 1083 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Organophosphates cause toxicity by:

Options:
  Combining with sulphydryl enzymes
  Increasing dopamine production in brain
✓ Inhibiting choline esterase
  Inhibiting cytochrome oxidase system
  Stimulating anterior horn cells of spinal cord

Explanation:
Organophosphate compounds exert their toxic effects by irreversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (typo 'choline esterase') enzymes. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses, resulting in overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors throughout the body.

================================================================================
Question 1084 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a rural village of 200,000 population. crude birth rate was recorded as 20 per 1000 population. In a year 40 maternal deaths were recorded in that village, Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of village was

Options:
  0.2/1000 live births
  6/1000 live births
  71000 live births
✓ 10/1000 live births
  12/1000 live births

Explanation:
Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is calculated as (Number of maternal deaths / Number of live births) * 1000 (if expressed per 1000 live births). First, calculate the number of live births: Crude Birth Rate (CBR) = 20 per 1000 population. For a population of 200,000, the number of births = (20/1000) * 200,000 = 4000 live births. Given 40 maternal deaths, MMR = (40 / 4000) * 1000 = 0.01 * 1000 = 10 per 1000 live births.

================================================================================
Question 1085 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
An epidemiologist noted that in a closed urban locality, 125 cases of corona occurred and only 25 survived. Killing power of corona is

Options:
✓ 200/0
  700/0
  900/0

Explanation:
'Killing power' refers to the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which is calculated as (Number of deaths / Total number of cases) * 100%. In this scenario, Total cases = 125, Survived = 25, so Deaths = 125 - 25 = 100. CFR = (100 / 125) * 100% = 80%. None of the provided options (assuming they mean 20%, 70%, 90%) match the calculated 80%.

================================================================================
Question 1086 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
To see the relationship between coffee drinking and carcinoma of pancreas, a researcher conducted a Cohort study, At the end of study, Population Attributable Risk was calculated as 75% Population Attributable Risk 75% means

Options:
  75% of population is having carcinoma of pancreas
✓ 75% of population can be saved from carcinoma of pancreas by eliminating coffee drinking
  Risk factor positive have 75 times more chances to develop carcinoma of pancreas as compared to risk factor negatives
  Prevalence of carcinoma of pancreas is 75/100 population
  There is probability of 75% that risk factor under study will cause carcinoma of pancreas

Explanation:
Population Attributable Risk (PAR) of 75% signifies that 75% of the disease incidence (carcinoma of the pancreas in this case) in the total population can be attributed to the specific exposure (coffee drinking). Therefore, eliminating coffee drinking could theoretically prevent or 'save' 75% of these cases in the population.

================================================================================
Question 1087 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In 2023, researchers designed a 20 years study design, to see the relationship of smoking and lung cancer. They decided to dig out the documented record of 5000 subjects from year 2003, The measure of association comes to be 4. This type of study is an example of

Options:
  Ambispective study design
  Case control study
  Nested case control study design
  Prospective cohort study
✓ Historical cohort study design

Explanation:
A historical cohort study (also known as a retrospective cohort study) involves identifying a cohort from past records (e.g., from 2003) and following them forward in time (conceptually or through documented data) to determine disease outcomes. The exposure (smoking) and outcome (lung cancer) are ascertained from existing records over the defined study period (20 years in this case).

================================================================================
Question 1088 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In screening test against diseases, cut off line plays an important role for sensitivity and specificity. Lead In: If we decrease the cut off line from 100mg/dl to 90 mg/dl, for screening of diabetes mellitus then

Options:
  True negative and false negative will Increase
  True negative will increase and false negative will decrease
  True positive and false negative will increase
✓ True positive and false positive will Increase
  True positive will increase and faise positive will decrease

Explanation:
Decreasing the cut-off point for a screening test means that more individuals will be classified as 'positive.' This action increases the test's sensitivity (correctly identifying those with the disease), leading to an increase in true positives and a decrease in false negatives. However, it also decreases the test's specificity (correctly identifying those without the disease), resulting in an increase in false positives (healthy individuals incorrectly identified as having the disease). Thus, both true positives and false positives will increase.

================================================================================
Question 1089 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
Blinding or masking is heart of Randomized clinical trials. Lead In: In a double-blind randomized control trial followings are masked

Options:
  Participants
  Observer
  Analyser
  Participants and analyser
✓ Observer and participants

Explanation:
In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, both the participants (subjects of the study) and the researchers (observers/investigators) who are administering the intervention and/or assessing outcomes are unaware of which treatment group each participant has been assigned to. This helps to reduce bias from participant expectations and observer interpretation.

================================================================================
Question 1090 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
A researcher inducted 1000 persons in a study for a period of 5 years to see the presence of disease in them. 50 persons left the study after remaining in study for 2 years. 1000 people were also inducted after 3 years. The best method to calculate No of new cases of disease for this type of study will be to calculate

Options:
  Attack rate
✓ Incidence density
  Incidence rate
  Prevalence rate
  Secondary attack rate

Explanation:
Incidence density (or person-time incidence rate) is the most appropriate measure for calculating the rate of new disease cases in a dynamic study population where individuals are followed for varying lengths of time due to staggered entry, loss to follow-up, or death. It accounts for the actual 'person-time at risk' contributed by each participant.

================================================================================
Question 1091 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a village of 2000 population (1200 males and 800 females), 48 females and 70 males died in a year. The sex specific death rate for female is

Options:
  2.4%
  6% female population
  60/1000 population
✓ 60/1000 female population
  population 1000/70

Explanation:
The sex-specific death rate for females is calculated as (Number of female deaths / Total female population) * 1000. In this case, (48 female deaths / 800 female population) * 1000 = 0.06 * 1000 = 60 per 1000 female population.

================================================================================
Question 1092 (WMC - 2023)
================================================================================

Question:
In a joint family there were 18 children from 3 to 12 years of age. 3 children had measles when they were 4 years old. 2 children were vaccinated with BCG at birth. Epidemiologist noted 11 children having measles in a short period of time. Secondary Attack Rate of measles is

Options:
  57.6%
  66.7%
✓ 71.4%
  83.3%
  97.5%

Explanation:
Secondary Attack Rate (SAR) is calculated as (Number of new cases among susceptible contacts / Total number of susceptible contacts) * 100%. Total children = 18. The 3 children who had measles previously are assumed immune. BCG vaccine is for TB, not measles, so the 2 vaccinated children are still susceptible to measles. Susceptible children = 18 - 3 (immune) = 15. If 1 of the 11 new cases was the primary case for this outbreak, then 10 children are secondary cases among the remaining 14 susceptible contacts. SAR = (10 / 14) * 100% = 71.4%.

Question 1146 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
Mean systolic blood pressure of 150 nursing students was recorded at 115 mm Hg with standard deviation of 3 mm Hg. The distribution is assumed to be normal. What percentage of nurses will have systolic blood pressure below 112 mm Hg?

Options:
  4%
  8%
✓ 16%
  20%
  24%

Explanation:
112 mmHg is exactly one standard deviation below the mean (115 - 3 = 112). In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of values fall within ±1 SD of the mean. This means the remaining 32% are outside this range, with 16% in each tail. Therefore, about 16% will have a systolic blood pressure below 112 mmHg.

Question 1161 (WMC - 2025)
================================================================================

Question:
After attending a wedding function, 80 people suffered from food poisoning. Four foods ( mutton karahi, chicken karahi, fish, Russian salad and custard)were served during that function and relative risk was calculated for each of these foods. It was concluded that mutton was not a source of food poisoning. What is the Relative risk of Mutton?

Options:
✓ 0.5
  1.1
  1.2
  1.5
  1.7

Explanation:
Relative Risk (RR) = (Incidence in exposed) / (Incidence in unexposed). If a food is not a source of poisoning, the risk of getting sick is the same whether you ate it or not. The RR would be 1.0. However, if it's protective or associated with *fewer* cases, the RR would be less than 1. Since RR of 1 is not an option and the conclusion is *not* a source, an RR slightly above 1 (1.1) would indicate no strong association, but 0.5 implies a protective effect. If we interpret 'not a source' as having no positive association, then RR would be ≤ 1. The question is a bit ambiguous, as RR=1.1 is also a very weak association. Let's assume 'not a source' implies no link at all (RR=1) or a protective link (RR<1). 0.5 is the only option < 1.
